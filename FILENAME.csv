This is pretty much the biggest red-alert towards legal nootropics in the US.,1245,8r7ipn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8r7ipn/this_is_pretty_much_the_biggest_redalert_towards/,469,1529058254.0,"So essentially, there’s this bill called Stop the Importation and Trafficking of Synthetic Analogues (SITSA) Act. It gives the DEA and the attorney general almost completely unchecked power to schedule any drug they see fit without following the currently established legal criteria to ban certain substances. In Section 2, Subsection 3B of the bill, this is the most worrying part that affects many different nootropics from phenibut to adrafinil or even kratom or tianepetine. 

“6)Schedule A
(A)In general
The drug or substance—

(i)has—

(I)a chemical structure that is substantially similar to the chemical structure of a controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V; and

(II)an actual or predicted stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to or greater than the stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V; and

(ii)is not—

(I)listed or otherwise included in any other schedule in this section or by regulation of the Attorney General; and

(II)with respect to a particular person, subject to an exemption that is in effect for investigational use, for that person, under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) to the extent conduct with respect to such substance is pursuant to such exemption.


(B)Predicted stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect
For purpose of this paragraph, a predicted stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system may be based on—

(i)the chemical structure, structure activity relationships, binding receptor assays, or other relevant scientific information about the substance;

(ii)

(I)the current or relative potential for abuse of the substance; and

(II)the clandestine importation, manufacture, or distribution, or diversion from legitimate channels, of the substance; or

(iii)the capacity of the substance to cause a state of dependence, including physical or psychological dependence that is similar to or greater than that of a controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V. “


This is concerning due to Phenibut having a similar pharmaceutical effect to Lyrica (schedule V) nd also being able to be (A) abused, and (B) can cause addiction or dependence similar to benzodiazepines or other GABApentinoids. 

Adrafinil is an analogue of Modafinil, a schedule IV drug, so it’s obvious why that could be banned immediately. 

Here is the link to the whole bill’s information, contact your reps, we need to stop this bill.

"I just learned that 10 minutes of ""wakeful rest"" (doing nothing / no sensory input) after learning was associated with 40% higher memory retrieval a week later. What are some other cognitive-enhancing phenomena everyone should know?",1116,afwze3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/afwze3/i_just_learned_that_10_minutes_of_wakeful_rest/,101,1547509296.0,"This is something that's important in a world with constant distraction: [Boosting Long-Term Memory via Wakeful Rest: Intentional Rehearsal Is Not Necessary, Consolidation Is Sufficient
](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109542). They gave two groups of people a free recall memory task. One group was then placed in a quiet room with no distractions for 10 minutes afterward, and the other group was given an additional cognitive task for 10 minutes afterward.

>Participants in the high sensory stimulation group completed 10 minutes of a spot-the-difference task, during which they were presented sequentially with 30 picture pairs on a laptop screen [2]. Their task was to identify and point to two differences between each picture pair within a 20-second time limit. Participants were instructed not to talk during the task, and care was taken to ensure that the spot-the-difference task was entirely visual: full instructions as well as a 1-minute practice trial were administered prior to Session 1 in order to minimalize verbalization during the delay. The spot-the-difference task was employed for two key reasons: firstly, it introduced new meaningful material and was cognitively demanding, thereby hampering word list consolidation [1]–[4], [6]. Secondly, it was non-verbal and highly unlike the word lists, thereby minimising potential interference at retrieval between word list memories and filler task memories [1], [2]. That is, the visual spot-the-difference task allowed us to examine the effect of sensory stimulation condition on word list consolidation specifically, without the potential confound of retrieval interference.

>Participants in the minimal sensory stimulation group were instructed to rest quietly in a darkened testing room while the experimenter went to ‘organize the next part of the study’ [2], [3]. To ensure minimal sensory stimulation, all equipment was turned off, and participants had no access to mobile phones, newspapers, etc.

What's interesting is that the additional cognitive task really wasn't that demanding, just pointing out two differences between laptops 30 times. That's not *so* dissimilar to making a comment on Reddit for 10 minutes, organizing your room for 10 minutes, etc. What this points to is the idea that you need rest not only *before* doing a cognitively-demanding task, but *immediately* afterward -- a 40% increase in material retrieval is absolutely insane. Even if commenting on Reddit is only 25% as cognitively demanding as pointing to differences in laptops, that's still a whopping 10% difference which is a full letter grade. 

I suppose to put this into practice you would need to take a 5 to 15 minute wakeful resting period after each chunk or subject that you are learning. So instead of stringing together programming / learning a language, you would pause for 10 minutes after each activity. You should also probably not text or move onto another task, unless the task is something that is similarly restful like walking.

What are some other psychological studies that people should know here?",2019-01-15 05:11:36

"Incredibly simple ADHD ""stack"". If you have ""cyclical"" ADHD symptoms, this could be the reason why.",811,a6it4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/a6it4n/incredibly_simple_adhd_stack_if_you_have_cyclical/,276,1544936383.0,"**EDIT 2: Posted a** [followup](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/aojy6q/a_followup_to_incredibly_simple_adhd_stack_if_you/)

**EDIT: Hey guys, glad you all like the post, but I want to make sure you're aware of some things.These symptoms also resemble bipolar disorder. They also resemble issues with your thyroid.Arguably, thyroid issues should be checked first. And if this stuff doesn't work (some stuff might need a bit of experimentation), there's a chance you have bipolar disorder.**

Hey guys, long time lurker here. My mind is blown, and I want to share my research/self-experimentation results.

**tldr;** Folic acid, B6, B12(methylcobalamin), **but NOT in a b complex** changed everything. Magnesium, when paired with these 3, make a large difference as well. The reason why is related to metabolic pathways in processing amino acids, namely Tyrosine and Phenylalanine.

I've had what I call ""cyclical"" ADHD for a long time now. Some months, feeling really good and able to manage my symptoms effortlessly, other months completely losing control of my brain. I've been on the lookout for the explanation for my ""cyclical"" symptoms for a while now. I felt like my diet influenced how I felt, but didn't understand why. I'm pretty sure I found it. A paper called ""Genetic variants of the folate metabolic system and mild hyperhomocysteinemia may affect ADHD associated behavioral problems"" seems to have confirmed my hypothesis.

# Here were my symptoms:

1. **Severe Exhaustion**: Even when focusing on getting a lot of sleep, can’t feel “awake”.
2. **Anhedonia**: Even things that normally make me really happy or excited really have no impact on me. Life feels flat.
3. **Brain Fog/Dissociation**: Difficulty focusing. At it’s worst, life begins to feel like a dream, tunnel vision of the mind (unaware of my surroundings).
4. **Stimulants have very little/no impact, or negative**: Was prescribed Concerta to help with my ADHD symptoms, and took it again after a long break. Negative symptoms. Did not help with arousal or wakefulness, but induced anxiety and strong negative energy. Caffeine does nothing, or very little.
5. **Tremor**: Tremor associated with how I feel. Will have a strong tremor when feeling terrible.
6. **Complete lack of motivation**: Nothing feels worth it, even things that are urgent or fun. Even feeding myself is a massive struggle.
7. **Cold**: Body temperature issues seem to happen when in this state.
8. **Sleep**: Despite being exhausted all the time, falling asleep isn’t as easy as it is during a “good” cycle. Sleep feels less replenishing.
9. **ADHD**: ADHD symptoms are only really present during these cycles. Focus, attention, stability, emotional control are all non-issues during “good” cycles.
10. **Vision problems**: (sometimes, when really bad) Blurry vision, have experienced weird shapes appearing in my view.

# Explanation:

The metabolic pathways of the brain neurotransmitters are **very** complicated, and some people are just not as good at producing some required enzymes as others, but in a nutshell:

I had hypothesized that my issues were related to producing **tetrahydrobiopterin** (BH4), which is required in processing phenylalanine (which is required in the production of dopamine and serotonin). This is directly affected by the amount of methylfolate available in the body. BH4 is unstable, and methylfolate ""protects"" it. There is a syndrome called Phenylketonuria (PKU) which mirrored my symptoms pretty well, right down to the tremor. I might have a ""mild"" form of this, since I've bypassed my symptoms in the past with diet. Having issues with BH4 production will raise the levels of phenylalanine in the blood, causing other cognitive issues.

Another theory I had, was that I had an issue with **Tyrosine Hydroxylase** (TH). Interestingly, BH4 is a cofactor to TH. An issue with BH4 will lead to an issue with with Tyrosine Hydroxylase. An issue with this enzyme would explain why Methylphenidate was unable to raise the amount of dopamine in my brain (after having not taken it for weeks). TH requires vitamin B6 to produce dopamine (oversimplification). It would also explain why NALT had such a strong impact on me but lost its effectiveness. A surplus of tyrosine in the brain won't do anything if there is a TH deficiency.

B12 is also a cofactor of serotonin and dopamine, however, I don't know in what part of the chain. When it comes to metabolic pathways, methylcobalamin is superior, both in bioavailability and when it comes to methyl groups. Methylcobalamin is the active form, and doesn't require any methyl groups, allowing for more production of methylfolate. A paper I read also stated that a lack of B6 and folate will also cause a b12 deficiency. If I find it again, I'll link it here.

**So why not in b complex**? There are huge interactions between the b vitamins, and some vitamins can undo another vitamins effect. For example, Niacin absorbs methyl groups, reducing your bodies ability to create methylfolate. This can reduce the amount of BH4 available in the body, negatively impacting Tyrosine Hydroxylase! Less TH, less dopamine. Furthermore, it's hypothesized that people with ADHD contain too much Serotonin. I've read a few studies that found that an excess of serotonin can decrease dopamine transmission. From my reading, niacin (somehow) promotes Serotonin. Niacin makes me feel horrible (long after the flush)

There are many, many other details. For further reading, I recommend reading :

[(Genetic variants of the folate metabolic system and mild hyperhomocysteinemia may affect ADHD associated behavioral problems)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29407547). Note that to read the whole paper, you'll probably need access to some university database.

The paper goes into much further detail, involving genetics, epigenetics, homocysteine's role in the pathophysiology of ADHD symptoms caused by metabolic issues.

Note: My background is not in biochemistry, but instead in engineering. Some stuff is also simplified into a ""nutshell"" form. There are many, many more details to this. I do not fully understand the intimate details, but loosely understand their relationship.

# Blood Tests

* A high blood level of phenylalanine indicates issues with BH4 production. Note that this likely indicates PKU, but might be mild and just aggravated by low methylfolate concentrations.
* B6 blood tests exist, but I'm not sure exactly how those work.

I wish I would have done these tests prior to taking these supplements, but since this regime works for me, why fix what's not broken?

# Stack Modifications/Additions

* **(B6)** Pyridoxal phosphate instead of Pyridoxine HCL could help some people with metabolism issues in creating the active form of vitamin B6. Be careful with excess B6, however, as it can cause neuropathy and liver damage.
* **(Folic Acid)** Methylfolate can be bought instead of folic acid, but folic acid is cheaper and effective for most people. There are some people that might benefit from this. Keep in mind that Methylfolate can have strong side effects.
* **Magnesium**: This one is well known, but lesser known is that the study commonly cited for magnesium's effectiveness with ADHD also paired magnesium with vitamin B6. The two appear to have synergistic effects?
* **BH4:** BH4 is available as a prescription medicine in the US/Canada under the brand name Kuvan. If you have a high level of phenylalanine in your blood, you likely could get a prescription for Kuvan.
* **Zinc:** This one is commonly known. Zinc is commonly low in ADHD patients. It helps me. Don't take too much.
* **SAMe:** This helps with methylation, which indirectly helps with BH4? This could help.

This is likely to only help a subgroup of ADHD patients, but it's worth looking into metabolic issues. This has really helped me.

edit: oh boy, lots to respond to. Didn't expect this to gather this much attention

Some other useful details:

Got a threatening message from Cortex Labs - bizarre experience.,730,82q1b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/82q1b6/got_a_threatening_message_from_cortex_labs/,191,1520472602.0,"I rated Cortex Labs on Facebook without leaving a detailed review. Nearly instantaneous, they not only replied to this review, but also sent me a threatening private message:

""You're going to want to remove that review, before we subpoena FB to find the IP address and location of the account your using. You are not a customer of ours, and are posting negative reviews for personal reasons. You have 36 hours to remove this review.""

I then edited my review (and lowered my rating from 2 stars to 1) and added in the details of the private message they sent me. 

Their reply? 

""And that wasn't a threat. It's a promise. Our attorneys don't let people get away with fraudulent public slandering.""

Which is rather strange, considering my initial rating didn't contain a single written word, and the edit only mentioned the threatening message I received from them - so I'm not sure how that could be considered ""slanderous"" in any way.

I told my friend about this experience who then also took to the comments, and we were swiftly accused of being the same person.

Over the next hour, 5 5 star ratings mysteriously appear, raising their average rating again (some having a suspiciously similar writing style). 

Unfortunately, I have since found out [this isn't the first time Cortex Labs has acted very unprofessionally](https://imgur.com/a/qb2rf) and from these sudden 5 star ratings appearing, this also now adds some serious shadiness as well.

Needless to say, this was bizarre. Has anyone else had a similar experience with them?


/edit: It is interesting to review this post a few hours later. Ryan came here with a fake account himself, spewing insults while presenting himself as a personal ""friend"" (the same thing he actually accused others of). He has also now disabled the review section on his Facebook page completely, purging it of ALL reviews in an attempt to hide his poor behavior. 

His product (Cortex Nootropic Stack) can still be reviewed on Amazon.

I also found this [hilarious review](https://www.naturalnootropic.com/cortex-generation-1-review/) where he also felt the need to to vigorously engage with the author in the comments.

My advice to Ryan: Learn some customer relation skills, or even better: Just learn how to be a better person.

/edit 2:
It seems Ryan wasn't content just posting in this thread posing as a friend.

Now he's fighting back, and he has some choice words for users in this subreddit.

He talks about it in his [newest video](https://youtu.be/qnuJSQClxi8?t=36s), essentially calling everyone a loser (with a bad job).

He also mentions this Conor McGregor quote:

>Winners focus on winning, losers focus on winners.

The irony of saying this while talking about other people (reddit users) seems to have been lost on him.

Unfortunately, it seems he didn't heed my advice about learning some customer relation skills or just being a better person.

All this over a wordless 2 star review that made him threaten me and claim my review was fake, because I didn't order this product from him. I guess he never realized I [could've just ordered it from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Cortex-Nootropic-Stack-Performance-Monophospate/dp/B01N26XS8D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8), or tried some from a friend?

At this point, I really do feel a little sorry for him - in his own words, he's supposedly a vet who was (or is still) suffering from PTSD. Of course that doesn't excuse his behavior, but I hope he realizes that acting the way he does certainly won't help him OR his business succeed.",2018-03-08 07:00:02

edit: Hey everyone FYI, my post title was misleading - upon closer inspection the study focuses on ayurvedic medicines in general and not specifically ashwagandha. On top of that, it didn't study brands that are popular currently (the study is almost a decade old) and so is not by any means an accurate reflection of what you're likely to encounter while shopping online. So it's doubtful that 20% of the Ashwagandha available currently is contaminated with unsafe levels of toxic metals.

That being said, given that there is no regulatory oversight with these products, some amount of wariness and caution is always warranted to some degree.

Fruit and vegetable consumption and cognitive decline in aging women.

Kang JH1, Ascherio A, Grodstein F.

Abstract

We prospectively examined fruit and vegetable intake in relation to cognitive function and decline among aging women. Participants were followed from in 1976 with biennial questionnaires, and food frequency questionnaires were administered in 1984, 1986, and every 4 years thereafter. From 1995 to 2001, we administered, by telephone, six cognitive tests measuring general cognition, verbal memory, category fluency, and working memory. We repeated assessments two years later for 13,388 women (>90% follow-up). We averaged dietary intakes from 1984 through the first cognitive assessment, and used linear regression to obtain multivariable-adjusted mean differences in performance and decline in performance across intake levels. **Fruits were not associated with cognition or cognitive decline. However, total vegetable intake was significantly associated with less decline**. Specifically, on a global score combining all tests, women in the highest quintile of **cruciferous vegetables** declined slower (by 0.04 unit; 95% confidence interval, 0.003, 0.07; p trend = 0.1) compared with the lowest quintile. Women consuming the most **green leafy** vegetables also experienced slower decline than women consuming the least amount (by 0.05 unit; 95% confidence interval, 0.02, 0.09; p trend < 0.001). These mean differences were equivalent to those observed for women about 1 to 2 years apart in age.

Lots of very deep discussion on nootropics, but also this might be THE most in-depth and organized coverage of my general thoughts on lifestyle and health ever!",495,6998fm,http://tim.blog/2017/05/04/smart-drugs-fasting-and-fat-loss/,62,1493950324.0,,2017-05-05 07:42:04
Cerebral Health Pyritinol Test Results (WARNING),493,1mmip9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1mmip9/cerebral_health_pyritinol_test_results_warning/,230,1379510752.0,"Many of you may remember the issue that came up with Cerebral Health/Bioscience Nutraceuticals a few months ago, where their choline bitartrate was numbing people's mouths. After sending those samples in to the lab, the tests came back negative for choline bitartrate. We suspected it was choline salacylate, but decided further testing to ascertain the exact compound would not be worth the cost. Unfortunately that was not the last issue to come from Cerebral Health.

A few weeks ago, another Redditor placed an order pyritinol from CH, along with some alpha GPC and oxiracetam. When the order arrived, both the alpha GPC and oxiracetam seemed alright. However, the pyritinol seemed off. Before thinking about it, he took his normal 400mg dose of pyritinol and went out for a mountain bike ride. Within 15-20 minutes he was getting a weird euphoria and detachment. After another couple minutes, his memory gets very fuzzy. 

Eventually his sister found him in the garage in a manic/psychotic state. He was biting his lips very hard, shaking, and holding his fists tight. Eventually he went into seizures when the paramedics came. He was taken to the hospital and seized again while waiting for the doctor. He had a crazed look in his eyes like what you see with people having a psychotic episode on MDPV. He was in the hospital for 4 days.

Not putting two and two together yet, he tried another small dose of pyritinol a few days after getting home, to see what effects came back. Sure enough, he started to get the euphoria and disassociation that he felt before. He also got the same crazed look in his eyes, and same rolling nystagmus. It tasted nothing like pyritinol, but more like burnt plastic. His cognition was off for a while due to the seizures, but he was sure it was the Cerebral Health pyritinol that caused it.

After doing some searching for similar reactions and physical properties online, he came to the conclusion that the compound was most likely a cathinone derivative like MDPV. All the effects fit with an overdose on something like MDPV. Since 400mg is a normal dose for pyritinol, but a massive dose for MDPV, that is most likely what caused the blackout and seizures. Since then he has been having intermittent seizures, and has been back in the hospital 3 times.

After speaking with the other moderators, we decided we needed to send a sample into the lab to get this tested. To prevent any accusations of tampering with the sample, I had another moderator order a whole new bag from them, then send a sample from that into the lab to be tested. So we now have two samples of the compound in question. The original one that sent the Redditor to the hospital, and the separate order we placed right after we became aware of the issue. Today the results came back, and it tested negative for pyritinol. I spoke to Colin at the lab, and he said that the FTIR did not match up at all, and that it was a completely unrelated compound. Due to legal constraints, the lab did not want to do a full workup on the compound apart from confirming it was not pyritinol. So we are going to be sending another sample from the same batch to Dacesafe.org to do a full workup. It will tell us exactly what the compound is, and what purity level it is at.

[Here is the result from Colmeric](http://i.imgur.com/cCOCMUs.jpg)

So in light of this, I suggest that nobody purchases anything from Cerebral Health. This is the second instance in the last 6 months where they have been selling a completely different substance than what it was advertised as. In this particular instance, it could even be a dangerous and illegal substance. Until we do a full workup, I cannot say for sure if this substance was MDPV or another cathinone derivative. However, it is definitely a psychoactive compound other than pyritinol. Obviously a lawyer is going to be brought in by the Redditor that went to the hospital, so I may have to take certain statements down eventually. However, I want everyone to be aware of this serious issue before it potentially puts another person in the hospital!

**EDIT: After further testing, the substance was identified as diphenhydramine (Benadryl).**

In his latest podcast (with Sinclair which was super interesting) he says he takes 3 different nootropic supps all of which have multiple ingredients. 

One of them is trubrain which is-

>L-theanine, Caffeine, Uridine, Centrophenoxine, Magnesium, Tyrosine, N-Acetyl Carnitine, Citicholine, Monk Fruit, Mangosteen, Nopal Concentrate, Noopept, Cane Sugar, Blue Agave, Purified Water, Xylitol, Nisin, Polylysine.

Okay so now what if you have a negative reaction to that? how on earth would you determine which specific ingredient you reacted to? same with a positive reaction. Its possible only one of those ingredients is helping you and the rest are just doing nothing or actually doing damage to your brain chemistry. You dont know!  

Also there are multiple cholinergic substances in that. Too much of that can fuck you up. 

Now consider he ALSO is taking 2 other nootropic supplement which ALSO have multiple ingredients! This is like 30 - 40 nootropic ingredients this man is sucking down for shits and giggles.

He seems to be following the ""Just take ALL the nootropics ALL the time! More and more! Balls to the Wall! Fuck yeah!"" approach

sorry but that if FUCKING STUPID! You are messing with your brain chemistry and turning your body into a ongoing chemistry experiment. Bad. Wrong. No. Dont do it, dont follow his lead. 

Do ONE nootropic at a time, see how you react and then adjust accordingly. 

Fucking Rogan man. How can he be so smart and so fucking stupid at the same time? 

Sorry for the rant but geez louise, this is how you get an industry over regulated.

***So I count 11 separate chemicals that boost acetylcholine levels***. Thats flat out stupid. These chemicals in your brain are supposed to be balanced, not too much not too little. There are multiple systems within your brain designed to regulate this. Taking 11 chemicals designed to wack out your ACH levels is just simply begging to have your brain chemistry fucked up. Unwise. Dont be like Joe, be smart.

A 10+ year nootropic enthusiast’s list of 20 obscure nootropics/supplements you may or may know about,425,bclp1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/bclp1g/a_10_year_nootropic_enthusiasts_list_of_20/,187,1555149469.0,"Just thought I’d share my experiences with some not-so-well-known nootropics/supplements I’ve taken. Most of them are Russian, which is probably why there aren’t much user experiences written about them on here or Longecity. Let me know if you want me to go into more detail on any of them or if you have any questions. If some of you find this list helpful I can make more lists of nootropics I’ve tried for different symptoms (mood, cognition, social anxiety, anhedonia). Check out my early post history for more reviews or my old account which I lost the password to and can not access anymore (/u/Nedzilla55). Anyways, here’s my list of 20 not-so-well-know (and a few we’ll know) nootropics/supplements. They’re listed in no particular order.



1) Pantogam and Pantogam Activ - Feels somewhat like Phenibut lite, without the extreme tolerance. Effects are not as intense as phenibut or Baclofen but it’s a nice little anxiolytic which is somewhat energizing as well (as strange as that sounds). Almost like a couple of drinks. Made it easier for me to just be myself (as weird as that sounds). You may find yourself humming in the car or listening to music while doing goofy dance moves from the early 2000s. Makes it easier to laugh and just enjoy myself while being in the moment.


2) Low Dose Amisilpride (12.5mg - 25mg). Don’t let the antipsychotic label scare you: that’s only at regular doses. At very low doses, it enhances dopamine transmission and facilitates dopamineric neurotransission and is a wonderful “as needed” mood brightener. Great for anhedonia. Helps to feel more “in the moment” and makes things like conversations with others more enjoyable.


3) Tenoten - Didn’t feel much from this one unfortunately. It’s supposed to work for anxiety and stress. Not too many experience reports online either (In English, at least). Might as well have been a sugar pill.


4) GABOB - Brain fog, sleepy ness, sedation... not a fan of this one. Benadryl type feeling almost. Not enjoyable at all and overall letdown IME.


5) Picamilon - Developed by Soviet Russia, this is considered a pro drug of GABA. It can be somewhat energizing or anxiolytic depending on the dose. Very subtle though, possible placebo effect. I haven’t found too many positive experiences online with this one either.


6) Agomelatine - This atypical antidepressant is an agonist at the melatonin receptors along with 5-HT2C antagonist. Helps me fall asleep when taken before bedtime, but has an activating/energizing feel upon waking up. Good alternative to try if you’ve had no luck with conventional antidepressants. I've read experience reports about it causing irritation at higher doses. I have not experienced this but YMMV.


7) Afobazole - This obscure little Ruski supplement feels somewhat anxiolytic but effects were pretty subtle to me. I may revisit this one with a higher dosage 


8) Sarcosine+NAC - Ok so this one may not be very obscure but I enjoy its effects so I figured I’d at least share. NAC literally cured my trichtillomania. It’s an amazing antioxidant. Taken an hour before drinking it prevents hangovers IME. Sarcosine is great for anhedonia and other “negative symptoms”. Makes it easier to engage with others and “feel”.


9) Grandaxin - This is an interesting one. Its commonly described as “anxiolytic” and “tranquilizing” though I would not really agree with that description. It’s an It feels activating physically yet quiets the mind. Too big of a dose caused irritability


10) Stresam - Nice little anxiolytic. Helps calm the mind and body. I like it to unwind after a stressful day at work. Puts me in a nice chill state when kicking back and watching documentaries or hanging out in nature


11) BPC-157 - Apparently it’s good for reducing stimulant tolerance and injuries? Again another one that may not be very obscure but I thought it may be of interest to some of you. 


12) Nefiracetam - I love this one. Nice little mood brightener. It’s hard to explain but it helps me connect the dots at work and when doing everyday activities. It makes it easy for me to read between the lines, especially in work/social situations. It’s almost like it makes me feel more aware. Like I was brushing my teeth one day on it and I just zoned out to the feeling of the bristles of my toothbrush going against my teeth and gums and just kind of had me in the moment. It made me think “why do I wet my toothbrush, maybe it’s better to leave it dry because the toothpaste sticks better to the toothbrush and my teeth”. This may or may not be wrong but I’ve had similar epiphanies on it. That may sound dumb but I don’t know how to better describe its effect on me. I wish someone would have this in stock again :(


13) Oxytocin - I took it before an interview and had the best interview in my life. I was so engaged with the interviewer and felt like we already had some sort of connection. It was very easy to express myself. My girlfriend said I was very romantic (lol) when I took it before going out to dinner with her (which is sort of unusual for me). Great for deep convos and connecting with others. This is one of those that I can clearly rule out a placebo effect.


14) Sulbutiamine - I had high hopes for this one but unfortunately did not feel much of anything despite trying many different doses. People on here and Longecity reported energizing effects. Maybe I’m just a non-responder?


15) Galantamine - this one is a cholinesterase inhibitor . Perefct for those who enjoy lucid dreaming. Increases acetylcholine in the brain, which may or may not be a good thing based on your personal neurochemistry. 


16) Semax - These next 2 are not very obscure to those familiar with nootropics but felt I should include them for some reason. This one is activating. I really like it for jogging, hiking, and other outdoor activities.


17) Selank - Semax’s chill twin brother. This one is more anxiolytic. I really enjoy walks in the woods with this one for some reason. Or just sitting on my back porch enjoying the nice weather and scenery.


18) P-21 - R.I.P. Ceretropic :( not sure if this is available anymore but I enjoyed its effects. It had more of an activating feel in my experience. Somewhat anxiogenic at times even. Not in a bad way though. Effects are hard to describe with this one.


19) D-Cycloserine - This one “aids in learning by helping form stronger neural connections”. Good for exposure therapy. I have a feeling this one would work much better when combined with CBT


20) GTS-21 - this one is a partial agonist at neural nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It is a horrible smelly yellow substance with a repulsive taste and it leaves yellow stains on anything it touches, including your hands. Felt somewhat anxiolytic though activating at the same time. I’ve only taken it for a week though. I may need to take it for a longer period of time to really feel its effects though. I will trial it for a month and report back it’s effects.",2019-04-13 15:27:49

Nearly two years ago, my brother (best friend) and I began working on NeuroGum, the first sugar-free caffeine + L-theanine nootropic gum. We saw all these other companies charging exorbitant amounts of money simply encapsulating caffeine and L-theanine, and we began brainstorming ways of creating an alternative that was delicious, affordable, and also portable. Beyond that, we wanted a way of making nootropics more accessible to the average consumer.

&nbsp;

So we borrowed some money and began experimenting by putting caffeine and L-theanine into a gum base. Of course, that first iteration tasted terrible and it crumbled apart. After a few unsuccessful attempts, we finally began working with a certified gum chemist, and over a dozen iterations later, we finally found a way of cold compressing:

* 40mg of caffeine
* 60mg of L-theanine
* 30% Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine Hydrochloride)
* 100% Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin)

into a piece of gum. Instead of aspartame, we used sorbitol, stevia, and a natural mint + vanilla flavor mix to mask the flavors and created our very own nootropic gum!

&nbsp;
        
I wanted to share to this subreddit because the amazing content here changed my life. We've been working super hard for the last two years and just launched on Indiegogo today. With the money we raise, we can finish our first production run and get our gum out to as many people as possible.

You can pre-order here on our Indiegogo page: http://igg.me/at/neurogum

and you can also check out our website at www.neurogum.com!

Once we launch, I promise I'll be back with some coupon codes for everyone here! If there's any questions, feel free to ask! This is my personal account so I'll be lurking in and out between shifts all day.

Cheers guys!

**EDIT: Wow. I'm absolutely thrilled. Yesterday, our Indiegogo campaign reached our goal, and now we can pay to finish our first production run. It's been such an overwhelming experience receiving feedback, support, and wonderful discussion for all of you here. After we talk with our manufacturer first thing tomorrow morning, we are going to begin working on some stretch goals like different flavors and our L-theanine gum.**

**This subreddit has been so amazing, and I can't be more grateful. Thank you all so much!**
 
**SO, for everyone who has already ordered, we sped up the timeline! We are going to work hard to get the gum shipped out as quickly as possible! We'll finalize the order tomorrow, receive it in two weeks, then set up something to get it out to you. I can't wait for you all to try NeuroGum!**

The study used Magnesium Di-Malate (supplement form is usually Magnesium Mono-Malate, should be similar), and Vitamins B6, B9 and B12, as it is known B6 improves Magnesium absorption.

After 30 days, the participants had a 6% higher RBC Mg content. After 90 days, however, the participants had a 30% higher RBC Mg content, which is considered a significant increase. The 6% increase at 30 days could be beneficial as well, but it shows that restoring normal Magnesium stores in the body can take a long time.

Magnesium Malate is known to be well absorbed, but even with its good absorption, it can take as long as 3 months to fix a deficiency. 

****

It seems like many people here decide that a certain Magnesium supplement is useless, after only a few weeks on it, and then switch to another one that they claim to find more effective. What might actually be happening, is that the multiple weeks of being on the first Magnesium supplement partially fixed the deficiency, making the second Magnesium supplement build on top of that, hence having more noticeable effects.",2018-09-13 09:36:19

I recently purchased 100g of what i believed to be Piracetam from Cerebral Health. After 3 days of dosing 2g in the morning i now feel what can only be described as brain damaged. I can no longer form coherent sentences, my memory is, well, ruined! I also find it hard to concentrate on anything which i found alarming so i contacted ""Professor Douglas. J. Phillips"", the owner of CH who i found to be not helpful whatsoever. I mean this guy flat out denied any problems with his products which is a complete lie! He asked about my diet which is fine, i also abstain from drinking alcohol albeit i was a heavy drinker in the past, and had a brief history of Cocaine use but that was years ago. I admitted this to help with Phillip's personal assessment but he stopped playing doctor by then and didn't reply.

After doing a google search on this SOB i found some alarming results:

**""David Ira Minkoff, M.D., who testified on Phillips's behalf, also had serious trouble. On August 3, 2001, the Florida Board of Medicine fined him $10,000 and suspended his license for one year, to be followed by two years of probation [3]. Minkoff, a Scientologist, was implicated in the death of Lisa McPherson, a Scientologist who allegedly died of malnutrition while in the custody of other Scientologists. Documents in the case indicate that even though Minkoff had never met McPherson, he prescribed sedative medication by telephone to Church of Scientology staff members who had called on her behalf. Although admitting no guilt, Minkoff reached a $100,000 settlement in 1997 in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by McPherson's estate.""**

After showing him this evidence he had the audacity to deny being the Douglas Phillips mentioned in this article, (even though there's a pic of him practicing his BS therapy in the quackwatch article.)

Like i care...

He's not even a professor, just some charlatan who gives people whacky alterative therapy. Anyways there's a growing number of reports detailing peoples' bad experiences with supplements purchased from CH that are not what they say they are. One of which is detailed here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1mmip9/cerebral_health_pyritinol_test_results_warning/


Whether or not it's Benadryl that i've taken an overdose of is for the doctors to find out. I have pain in my kidney areas and urine smells really foul, not that piss is suppose to smell nice anyway lol. I'm going for a blood test Monday and have been told to bring along the ""Piracetam"" so it can be tested. I have contacted the FDA who are very interested and also want me to send a sample. If there's any long term damage caused i'm not going to give up till this guy is finished!


Mr. Phillips also posts on http://brainmeta.com/forum/ under the pseudonym of ""GodConsciousness"", discrediting any bad experiences as companies merely trying to stain his already bad reputation. LOL! Not to mention his company sponsors the brainmeta forum (facepalm).

Yes, this is my fault and i agree i should have done more research before purchasing but if i can prevent this from happening to someone else i'll be happy.

So there has been some interest in LSD after some posts about microdosing, and I have a lot of experience microdosing on and off as well as experience taking full doses of LSD, mushrooms, and MDMA for the sole purpose of self development.

If you haven't already read my previous post, I have an [LSD trip report](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/5ajwd6/this_was_the_most_meaningful_experience_of_my/) as well as my MDMA trip report that I [just posted on /r/Drugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/5utmoj/mdma_might_be_the_greatest_therapeutic_substance/).

Some things to consider. DOSAGE MATTERS. Effects do NOT follow a linear scale. In other words. 25mcg is not ""double"" the feeling of 12.5mcg. Also 50mcg is completely different than 100mcg. You could be jittery on one dose and totally focused on another.

---

**Objectives - LSD**

I've been obsessed with self development, so what drew me to psychedelics was a few things. 

* Psychedelics take your essence and allow you to observe it as though you were looking at yourself from the objective perspective of a completely different human being. You gain an insane hyperawareness into your thoughts and behaviors that would take months to truly understand otherwise. Even if you can logically deduce something for yourself in a sober state, psychedelics helps you ***internalize this logic in a significantly more effective way***.
* Psychedelics increases neurogenesis (see below)
* Psychedelics can help rewire synapses that feel extremely hard wired (ie. people often completely quit smoking the day after. Bad habits are significantly easier to understand and reform after the fact, etc)
* Psychedelics make you better appreciate the world around you, which in turn removes the pressure to perform and thus makes you perform better
* Psychedelics help you reform bad habits and put you on a good track towards developing new habits.

Here is an excerpt that summarizes psychedelic effects on neurogenesis:

>LSD does cause an increase in BDNF, and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. LSD can be described as polyamorious in that is binds to every single seratonin and dopamine receptor. To have a greater affect on neuroplasticity and neurogenesis you really want activation of the three rectptors mentioned earlier. This is where psilocybin enters the conversation. Psilocybin has greater affinity for the three sites mentioned, and the effect of neurogenesis and neuroplasticity is also greater, because of the selectivity of psilocybin. 

So why LSD over Mushrooms even though mushrooms have an arguably greater effect on neurogenesis? The short answer is control. Shrooms are like a magical train ride into the alien depths of your brain. It could be a good time, it could be a bad time, but once you board there's no getting off. A good trip sitter can help adjust the tracks and get you through a ""bad experience"", but you can't really will yourself into a different mindset as easily.

If you really want to get a scientific understanding of LSD and its effects, please read Dr. Fadiman's book. It has tons of objective studies, quantitative data, etc that backs up the aforementioned bullet points. I'm not going to do your homework for you so take what I say with a grain of salt and do your own research if what I'm saying doesn't make sense to you. There are dozens of studies out there.

Now to be clear, the chance of having a bad trip on shrooms with a good trip sitter is more rare than you think, and a lot of people say that their ""bad trips"" were incredibly insightful and ultimately productive nonetheless, but some people can't handle the unknown, so it's important to know yourself. Regardless, you will come out of the other side with new insights and what you do with them is up to you.

*TL;DR:* The objective for me was to better understand my flaws and work to overcome the bottlenecks in my own personality to become a better, more intelligent, and more efficient person in my pursuit of self development.


---

**Objectives - MDMA**

At first I wasn't very interested in MDMA, but after doing it I realized it's absolutely incredible in ways that LSD could NEVER be.

* MDMA works on the parts of your brain that regulate fear, empathy, trust, and openness
* MDMA is in the final stages of FDA approval
* MDMA allows you to take the most traumatizing memories of your life and come to terms with them in ways that would take months or years with traditional therapy alone
* MDMA can help you understand and overcome the paralyzing fears of failure, self-doubt, and personal rigidity

---

**Giving my friends LSD/MDMA in therapeutic sessions**

After experiencing all this myself I truly wanted to share it with everyone I knew. I carefully reached out to friends I knew who had major to minor issues with personality, relationships, etc and took them through my protocol.

* One friend went from smoking 1 pack of cigarettes every 2 days to smoking 1 pack every 2 weeks. If she had a little more self control in general i'm certain she could give it up entirely. She was also able to realize that she was in a toxic relationship and leave her crazy bf after realizing some important things during her trip. She also expressed a new appreciation for nature after walking in the park during her trip.
* Another friend who took 250mcg of LSD told me she suddenly realized that the source of her anger had been her father all along, who had left her and her siblings when she was young. She thought that she had come to terms with this but the LSD made her realize it was still deep within her mind and causing her to be constantly angry. It's been more than a month since her trip and she has expressed that she rarely ever gets angry. She also told me that she sees ""through"" people and has extraordinary insight into manipulative behavior whereas before she would take things at face value. She's been able to register for classes after a long hiatus due to her feeling uncertain about her life. She has a lot more confidence now
* Another friend who had severe self-esteem issues due to his constantly disparaging wife realized his self worth and was able to overcome his paralyzing self-deprecation. He is now studying for a certification to go back to work on a subject he's always been passionate about but too afraid to pursue due to his own mental obstacles.
* My best friend and her husband took MDMA and resolved some of the biggest barriers in their relationship practically overnight. Both of them were able to talk so freely about what was on their mind while simultaneously accepting each other that it literally made all their arguments seem petty and moot. Their relationship is still significantly more open and stronger, 4 wees after the fact. They understand each other better and feel like there's more empathy in the relationship.

Why do I do this? There is nothing more fulfilling to me than seeing people ***reach their fullest potential***. It's a beautiful thing and I love trip sitting.

**Who I am on a microdose**

Microdosing is great because it's subtle enough that no one would notice except you. When I microdose I'm more amped about life, about the task at hand, and have a noticeable improvement in drive and motivation to get shit done. I've realized that I'm more creative; I have better ideas, and my ideas are more fluid and less traditional, I'm appreciably more witty, social, and more of a badass. This is all really subjective but after months of microdosing I am pretty certain I can distinguish the effects that are unique to LSD here. Though I'm typically very introverted and basically glued to my computer at home most of the day, on a microdose I can effortlessly decide to go out, check out events, or decide to do something social that otherwise would take a lot of mental energy.

It's important to know that even on a microdose, *you're still the captain of your own ship and are responsible for the outcome*. It's way easier to have a good time and work towards developing good habits on a microdose, but it's not quick fix where you pop an 1/8th tab and wait for magic to happen. It is merely a catalyst for great things, and microdosing every 3 days will help you build upon smaller successes.

The purpose of microdosing is to put your mind in a ""learning state"" that makes new habits more ""sticky"". And by consistently microdosing and practicing something the stickiness will build up and the habit will remain with you more strongly.

---

**Permanent Outcomes**

I would dare to say that the human being I am now is incredibly different than who I was 4 months ago when I started everything. I'm significantly more aware, more straightforward with people, daring, open, creative, and I definitely give no effs compared to before. I work and I do what I think I need to do without worrying about the outcome as much. I ***completely*** know who I am now, inside and out. I've come to terms with my weaknesses as a person, accepted them, and am learning how to work around them to get what I want. Other weaknesses I've gotten rid of completely. I know why I used to be avoidant, I know why I treated people certain way, and I know what I need to do to shatter my personal boundaries. I'm still a work in progress but the path is clear now, and I'm excited at the opportunity to challenge myself further.

**Eterneraki's Protocol for getting the best out of LSD & MDMA**

I think it's absolutely imperative to do both eventually. They are like yin and yang. LSD takes a scattered room and helps you gain insight from seemingly unrelated thoughts. MDMA makes you accept the things you've had difficulty accepting and makes you realize that things aren't nearly as big of a deal as you once thought. Just fucking go for it.

If you have anger or anxiety issues I recommend MDMA FIRST. Then a week or 2 later you can do LSD.

Prior to either MDMA or LSD take a week to do the following:

* Practice mindfulness meditation (headspace is a great app) for at least 10 minutes every day
* Take 5-10 minutes every night and write a journal entry. Personal reflections, examine your mood and start thinking about what you want to accomplish during your trip
* Start preparing a list of at least 5 questions you would want to ask yourself during the trip. Some questions may include ""What holds me back from X?"" ""Why is my relationship with this person X?"" ""what do I like about myself?"" ""Why am I afraid/worried/etc about X?"" The more specific the better, but general questions are better than no questions
* Clear out the ENTIRE day that you will be tripping. On the day of, silence your phone and get it out of the way. Your trip sitter should ask you the questions you've prepared right after your peak (~4 hours in).
* Journal the night after your trip as well as the next day or 2 afterwards

MDMA Protocol is 100mg (up to 120 if you're on the heavy side), then 60-75mg 2 hours after the first dose. This is basically the same as the MAPS therapy program. Trip will last 4-6 hours

* Mix the powder in a drink (powder is really bitter, juice is better than water). DO NOT CHUG IT or you will feel nauseous when it all hits you at once. Take sips here and there and finish it over a 3-5 minute span of time. Make sure you eat a light meal 2 hours before. Anything more will either delay onset or reduce effects.

LSD Protocol is 150mcg preferably in the morning (the earlier the better). Trip will last 6-8 hours and you will be tired as fuck. 

In both scenarios it's important to be with someone (SOBER) who cares about you.

AFTERWARDS - This is when the real work begins. Take your new insights and realizations and make a plan to practice being a better you. If you want to microdose take 12.5mcg every third day in the morning. You may do this for 10 weeks straight. Microdosing is safe and very few (if any) adverse events have been noticed by the vast majority of people. Continue reflecting, meditating, and documenting your progress. A support system is tremendously helpful.

**Where to buy - precursor vs actual drug**

/r/darknetmarkets

I personally buy from ""pushing taboo"" (look it up)

precursor lsd as far as I know is just as potent/useful. It's a little more expensive though so I prefer to just buy LSD straight up.

---

**Abuse**

Both can be abused but MDMA is significantly easier to abuse. Newbies can take MDMA again a few weeks after the first, but the recommendation is at least 6 weeks. If you've taken MDMA twice in 2 months, you should wait 3 months before your next roll. 4 times a year thereafter is optimal. Any more than that and you risk falling into the abyss (and it's not fun from what I heard).

LSD is so exhausting that you probably will never want to touch the stuff again, but some people still manage to abuse it. 1 full trip every 6 months is more than enough.

Don't be a fucking idiot.

---

**Safety**

[This graph is a good tl;dr](http://imgur.com/KV6TdKM) 
(Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs)

I'm pretty exhausted from writing all of this out but there are numerous studies on the safety profile of LSD, MDMA, and shrooms. They're completely safe when not abused. Be aware of potential drug interactions if you're on SSRIs or something else.

Summary:

Antibiotics strong enough to kill off gut bacteria can also stop the growth of new brain cells in the hippocampus, a section of the brain associated with memory, reports a new study in mice. Researchers also uncovered a clue to why -- a type of white blood cell seems to act as a communicator between the brain, the immune system, and the gut.

I am writing to you to express my opposition to HR 2851, the SITSA Act. As a lifelong (insert state here), I embrace a healthy and active lifestyle like many of our neighbors. I have followed the news in recent years as there has been a substantial increase in overdose deaths across our country - half of these deaths each year are attributed to illicit substances, with fentanyl and fentanyl analogues contributing to a larger percent of the share year over year. Legal pharmaceutical drugs account for approximately half of these overdose deaths each year.

Further legislation regarding fentanyl is redundant, as legislation has already accomplished what the SITSA Act is intended for. The Federal Analogue Act passed in 1986 gave authority to prosecutors to treat synthetic analogues the same as the drugs they resemble. In November 2017, the DEA passed emergency scheduling for all fentanyl analogues.

I believe the SITSA Act is an unnecessary overreach by our government. It consolidates all scheduling powers with our Attorney General - without consulting physicians, scientists, or public health experts. With this act, scheduling of a substance would become a subjective rather than an objective process. Harmless, legal supplements that people use everyday for health and wellness can be included under the scope of having similar effects to illicit substances, not based on chemical structure, pharmacology, dependence, or physiological effects on the body. If the goal is to enforce criminal penalties against fentanyl analogues, prosecutors already have the necessary tools to prosecute fentanyl analogues.

Please vote no HR 2851!

Thank you for your time.

Welcome to /r/nootropics, a subreddit that focuses on enhancing the brain through different methods (pills, exercise, meditation, anything). We'll hopefully be able to help you with your problems and get the extra edge you're most likely looking for. 

So first some background, it all started with Dr. Corneliu E. Giurgea 40-50 years ago (it didn't really, but the history is easier this way). In the 60's Dr. Giurgea first synthesised piracetam, the now well known drug. For almost a decade he must have thought ""Hmm, how can I become more famous, make up a new word and start a new class of drugs?"" and then it finally hit him! If he made up a new word, added some criterias and then published it, he had it all figured out! So in 1972 he published a study that first used the word nootropic (which means to bend the mind) and decided on some criterias. The criterias are:

1.    They should enhance learning and memory.
2.    They should enhance the resistance of learned behaviors/memories to conditions which tend to disrupt them (e.g. electroconvulsive shock, hypoxia).
3.    They should protect the brain against various physical or chemical injuries (e.g. barbiturates, scopalamine).
4.    They should increase the efficacy of the tonic cortical/subcortical control mechanisms.
5.    They should lack the usual pharmacology of other psychotropic drugs (e.g. sedation, motor stimulation) and possess very few side effects and extremely low toxicity.

To make it easier for you, most people don't use this definition, ""nootropics"" is commonly used as ""cognitive enhancers"" (which might be neurotoxic, have serious sides, etc). I would like for everyone to stop doing this, but it will obviously not happen but please try. 

The real history goes way back. Humans have always been trying to improve their wetware, Ayurvedic, Shamanism, Chinese, Korean, Siddha, Tibetian, etc have all had herbs and the like to enhance cognition in some ways. That's all I'll say, I know way too little about it. 

You've now decided to start on your noot (short for nootropic) and improvement journey, great! We're glad to have you! But first of all I want to give you realistic expectations. Most noots will not be super noticable or enhance any brain function by a lot, we're just not there yet. Some drugs that seem insanly good in animal models do not transfer to humans at all. Then we have the problem with noots that you do not feel, but still ""works"" (an example for me would be [LLLT](http://www.gwern.net/LLLT)). But as always, people do not respond identically to drugs, you need to try things to know for sure. If you want to feel something you will most likely need to try stimulants or potentially an anxiolytic if you've got anxiety. Also be cautious of interactions, search and read lots before you add new things.

So now that you realise that noots aren't anything like NZT-48 in the movie Limitless we can move on. 


Before you start supplementing things you should get your lifestyle in order. The first thing you should take care of is your sleep. Try to get your +-8 hours and enhance the quality. When you got that in order you should start exercising, both cardiovascular (which got a lot proof for being a cognitive enhancer) and strength (not as much evidence, but more is coming). Try to be active during the day (try not to sit all day, exercise for one hour and think you're good), it'll help sleep and everything in your life. When you're done with those two things you have a good foundation, but adding meditation will help even more. It'll help with any anxiety you have, make you happier and a lot more (cognitive enhancing things). If you don't want to try meditation for some reason, look into neurofeedback. If you do not know how to fix these things, check /r/fitness, /r/meditation and /r/sleep, just check our sidebar relevant subreddits. 

When you got that fixed you could look into your diet. This part is super controversial due to different schools of thought. First we have the more mainstream, low GI-carbs, lots of ""good"" fats, lowish saturated, etc. But we also got a bit of the opposite (/r/keto), low carb, high fat (any except for transfats), etc. This forces the body to go into ketosis (your cells run on more ketones (except for a few cells)) which might hold some benefit for different populations. There's some research hinting towards being in ketosis might be good if you have blood sugar issues (which might cause alzheimer's later in life and cell damage all through), but to me, it does not seem to hold more promise than that. I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me on this, but you need to make up your own mind and do what you want and find practical. Something almost everyone seems to agree on is that veggies and fruits (ketoers does not like the last one as much as veggies), this is backed up by a lot of research. This is due to multiple things, one of which is that veggies and fruits contain a lot of polyphenols with unique effects. Broccoli has been shown to reduce the effects of (some aspects of) autism, blueberries have shown to fight alzheimer's, etc. 

There's also a bunch of supplements that are usually not seen as noots but still have positive effects. The first group would be vitamins. There are a few that most people are deficent in, mainly vitamin K and D. Vitamin K (in the form of K1) is usually just found in leafy greens and K2 (which we usually prefer to supplement) in a few fermented foods. The health effects are quite important for preventing cardiovascular, bone and potentially neurological problems. Vitamin D has in recent years been promoted as the cure all, which it's obviously not. It is however very good for you. There are a lot of correlations between auto-immune diseases and higher mortality in vitamin D deficent people. Adding 2000-5000 IU of D3 daily (and keeping your blood levels checked) should fix the deficency for most people. 

If we move within the group micronutrients, but don't look at vitamins, we find minerals. The most significant in this category (relevant to us) is magnesium. To describe it in simple terms, it helps you calm down, promotes synaptic plasticity, help depression, long-term memory and a gazallion other things related to enzymes. If you take it before sleep you'll get better sleep quality and fall asleep faster. There are however forms that have been shown to be fairly worthless, mainly magnesium oxide. You will have to look up what form you want to supplement with. Just be sure to not take too high doses, it might act as a laxative!

Another mineral worth checking out is zinc. Deficency might lower testosterone and BDNF levels, both which are highly correlated with depression and cognitive functions. Doing too much might have opposite effects on BDNF levels and be toxic, so try to not overdo it. A normal starting dose would be around 15-25 mg, adding copper at other times might also be worth looking into. 

If we leave the micronutrients and look into other supplements that are worth looking into, we quickly find creatine. /u/silverhydra calls it a pseudovitamin (because real defiency results in retardation) which means we must look into it! Creatine is a molecule with a phosphate group bound to itself, if you remember your high school biology you'll remember that ATP becomes ADP and needs a new phosphate group to become ATP again. Guess where you can get that group from? Exactly, creatine! When your cells use up ATP your creatine phosphate donates its group and regenerates ATP. This has been found to be extra effective for vegetarians who consume small quantities of creatine. They are one of the few groups that actually might get an IQ increase from adding it! Other groups that would benefit from it would be elders, sleep deprived and potentially everyone else. It's neuroprotective, might raise your IQ, might make you live longer, modulates a billion things, there's really no reason not to take it. 

You've probably browsed multiple sites for starting your stack and then found /r/nootropics, so you want us to help you get started. Sure can do! There are four beginner stacks usually mentioned, the caffeine + theanine, noopept, bacopa and the piracetam (+ choline).

But something important before you order ANYTHING, get a damn milligram scale! As you're most likely not doing anything that requires exact measurements, something cheap like Gemini-20  will work. It will run you about $20 and will last you a very long time. This is for your own safety only (and I know you'll get hate/no help if you create a thread asking about what 200 mg looks like in powder form). Be also cautious with what source you use. Scammers pop up all the time in the noot world, some selling things that have caused hospitalisation. Check the sidebar for suppliers that are trusted, a guideline is to mainly buy from sellers than can provide third part CoAs (Certificate of Analysis). 

Have you heard about theanine before? If you have, it has probably been in the context of tea. If you have not, theanine is an amino acid analogue that we mainly find in tea. Why are we adding it to our lovely caffeine? Theanine seems to induce a state of calm, but still keep you alert/awake. Adding caffeine to it boosts the alert/awake, thus making the caffeine nicer for you. There are multiple studies on the combo with positive results (and on the individual compounds). If you're already drinking coffee you can pour some theanine in your cup and enjoy it more. The commonly recommended ratio between theanine and caffeine is 2:1 T:C. But be sure to play around with the ratio to see what works best for you. A good starting dose would be 50-100 mg caffeine and 100-200 mg theanine. 


Maybe you don't want to use caffeine, you want to expand your stack or have some other reason to add other things. Then you might want to start with piracetam and choline.  This stack has less scientific, but a fair amount of anecdotal evidence (if you care about that). Piracetam was first synthesised by Dr. Giurgea and his team and had some success. The mechanism is not fully understod yet (as with many other drugs) and some argue it's mainly good for the older population, fighting off the age related decline in brain function. The choline is added because one of the mechanisms seems to be cholinergic (the scientific evidence for adding it is weak, anecdotal is not as weak, but still not that strong). When you're adding choline you should be mind the dose. Too high dosages seem to induce depression in a lot of people. The dosage here is a bit more spread between users. Piracetam is taken in doses between 800-4800 mg, 1-3 times a day and choline is taken at doses around 200-1000 mg depending on form. You should however not buy any form of choline, there are better and worse sources. The worst source is choline bitartrate, which should be the last waw out (get some other form if you can). The better forms are Alpha GPC and CDP-Choline. You should try with and without choline to make sure how you respond to them. Try adding them one at a time, as you should with any supplement. 

Maybe you don't like the former ones, maybe want to try new things or maybe have some interest Russian drugs. Then you might be interested in noopept, a dipeptide. The evidence is even less for noopept, basically zero in humans in the western world. The mechanism for this one is even less researched. The doses for this compound is 5-30 mg 1-3x daily, orally or sublingual. Too high doses seem to impair working memory for some people, so it's best to start low. One of the creators have been interview by Smart Drug Smarts which you can listen to [here](http://smartdrugsmarts.com/rita-ostrovskaya-noopept/). 

Maybe you're one of those people who prefer to take ""natural"" things, then we have a herb for you! The herb I'm talking about is the adaptogenic herb Bacopa Monnieri. Bacopa has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for many years, but as with the other drugs, the mechanism is still not fully understod. The dose used is usually 300-500 mg if it's 50% bacosides. Don't get sad if you don't notice any effects right away, it takes time for it to work. Most trials with good results take it for weeks, it's usually recommended to be taken for atleast 8 weeks, then people usually start noticing it. 

There are lots of pre-made stacks, but almost all of them have the same problem, under dosed/don't tell the dose, over priced and no proof that the things they use are pure. So research A LOT before buying them.


As I've written before, there are non-supplemental ways to enhance your cognition. Remember the thing I talked about when I said it was important to measure things? It was LLLT, also called Low-Level Laser/LED/Light Therapy. It sounds like something a hippie made up, but there is a lot of evidence behind it. LLLT works by using a light source (in the 600-1000 nm range) and shining it where you want (in my case the skull (for the brain)). The photons are absorbed by cytochrome C which increases its activity and thus increase ATP production. It does a whole lot more related to it and has been shown to improve reaction time, improve memory, etc. For more info you should search this subreddit and get over to lostfalco's thread on longecity. Another thing that is a bit more risk would be tDCS, transcranial direct current stimulation. Exactly how and how good it works is fairly unknown, but preliminary data hints at some great results. If you want a high quality unit you will need to spend a few hundred bucks, if you can build one you'll save a lot. There's really no way to explain this without going overboard (placement, intensity, hormones and a lot of other things plays a role in the effect), so head over to /r/tDCS if you're interested. 

There are also other ways that just requires your computer, so called brain games! The current brain game that has most evidence is n-back. To keep it short a few studies has shown that it increases working memory and potentially IQ (which is disputed), it's one of the few games that have evidence behind it. The most common form is dual-n-back, where you are keeping track of a sound and a position. If you want to learn more, /u/gwern has by far the best papers on it which you can read [here](http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ) and [here](http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20meta-analysis).

This is also a good way to keep measuring how effective some of your noots are. Other brain games have not shown as much potential, but can be a way to measure progress. Sites that offers these are [Luminosity](http://www.lumosity.com/ ) (Paid) and [Cambridge Brain Sciences](http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/ ) (Free), simple apps for reaction time are also worth looking at.

"Update: Guide to Healing Your Gut - Thoughts, Dietary Suggestions, Supplemental Alternatives, and Depression.",312,63bqj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/63bqj7/update_guide_to_healing_your_gut_thoughts_dietary/,95,1491305145.0,"Hey again. [After reading through the comments on my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/630czc/guide_to_healing_your_gut/), I got the impression that a lot of you thought the supplement regimen was too much and didn't like the idea of pounding a bunch of capsules every few hours(which I totally understand, but sometimes depression, anxiety, and IBS can make you desperate enough to do so). My intention with the post was to help people who need an overall solution to an incredibly stubborn problem, and attack it from all angles. While it might seem like overkill to some folks, I think we forget how persistent and relentless an IBS problem can be, and I believe its primarily due to the gut mucosal layer and intestinal microvillus not being there to keep the flora intact, typically as a result of bad diet. While I still think there quite a bit value in taking all these supplements together, I don’t think it is required for long term use if you eat properly after starting it. Once you get the gut back to being completely healthy and diverse with the proper flora, it goes back to what it was like when you were a kid; eating a poptart and a pepsi for breakfast everyday and shitting just fine. Not saying you should do that, but having good gut health allows you to have some fun sometimes and not worry the next day. That’s a really valuable thing, at least it is for me. 

**Probiotics**

One of the primary reasons why I suggested the GOL(34 Strain 100+ billion CFU) probiotic was because of the amount of strain variety you get. While there may be negligible amounts of some of the latter strains, with the proper prebiotic fiber, they can still flourish and populate your gut effectively with many different cognitively beneficial strains of bacteria that aren't as available in food(not to mention how gross some fermented food is). With Probotic drinks or foods, you often don't get as much variety and nor do you get the exact details of which strains are populated within. Kefir tends to produce a lot of the Lactobacillus strains that can exacerbate histamine issues, and thus allergies/inflammation. Kombucha's bacteria profile has some bad strains like Candida which can often make high sugar/fructose diet floras much worse, as candida loves it sugar... In its entirety, its great stuff that everyone should be drinking IN ADDITION to probiotic supplementation (but not at the exact same time - probiotic in the morning/kombucha at night). Considering that, it's incredibly hard to get a diverse microflora when just relying on food. You'd need to consume all kinds of things such as Kefir, Natto, Kimchi, Sauerkraut, Kombucha, Greek Yogurt, and a handful of others. Personally, I'd rather just take a high strain/CFU probiotic daily and consume those other probiotics sources a few times a week. We want to cover all the bases right? Flora diversity, intestinal mucosa, and microvillus health are all dependent on each other – we need gut homeostasis and equilibrium if we want the cognitive benefits too. 

**Intestinal and Mental Health**

As some of you may know, the ""leaky gut"" label has gotten a bit of criticism as of late for its overuse with Naturopaths and other pseudoscience based health advisers. While I still think there is a massive amount of research to be done to confirm its validity, it's safe to say that there are strong correlations between gutflora/intestinal health and all kinds of life debilitating neurological disorders. This is an emerging science that I believe is on the brink of changing how we look at healthcare. There is a second brain in our body, and what you feed that brain has profound effects on your overall health and equally your perception of reality. What happened to the old saying ""you are what you eat""? If you consume a diet that is high in fat and sugar, your stomach bacteria will be fundamentally different than someone who is on a vegan diet. If you were to take two identical twins from the same starting age and feed one a high sugar/carb diet with little fiber and the other a perfect Paleo/Mediterranean diet high in fiber and good fats, they would turn out to be two fundamentally different people cognitively and behaviorally. I could almost guarantee that the kid with the high carb processed diet would turn out with less mental acuity, emotional intelligence, and overall health. He’d probably get an ADHD diagnosis early, and may even exhibit symptoms on the autistic spectrum before he hits puberty. What if this is entirely implicated by your gut bacteria and diet? What if the antibiotics that he took when he was 10 permanently destroyed a strain of bacteria in his gut that was benefiting him cognitively, and he was never the same after? I dunno about some of you, but I fell into a deep depression coincidentally after I had done a couple years of antibiotics and I’m still slowly getting my shit together. If gut bacteria and intestinal health are important enough to effect neurotransmitter levels, BDNF production, neurogenesis, and other beneficial cognitive functions, then shouldn’t our goal be to have a healthy flora above all else?

The more I read about this, the more I feel like we have been misled and unjustly coerced into an unhappy life through the diets forced on us via advertising and grocery store isles. If you look at how food affects you neurologically, then it’s safe to say that the typical American diet is probably one of the “most addicting”. Sugar is addicting, period. It light’s your brain up the exact same way that cocaine does and while it doesn’t have the same systemic addictive effects, you certainly have withdrawals if you cut a 500g a day sugar habit to 0. Same goes for fatty or unhealthy processed food. The goal of any bacteria is to grow and populate. It’s in the gut bacteria’s evolutionary best interest to continue pumping out feel good neurotransmitters that your brain likes, so your brain will associate that food with positive emotions and try to maintain the cycle. Does it suffice to say that your second brain might have some control over you?  





**Dietary Suggestions and Supplemental Alternatives**

Everyone should already be taking magnesium, vitamin D, and digestive enzymes. You can’t get NAG from diet, so this is only thing I'd recommend supplementing. If you want the maximum benefits, then please eat right while introducing these strains of bacteria into your gut. Taking probiotics with a bad diet isn’t a good idea in my opinion. You risk the chance of developing worse problems if one of the “good strains” gets out of whack too and wreaks havoc on your immune system or inflammatory process. Paleo/Mediterranean diet is what I’d recommend following being that keto can be a tad low on fiber. You want lots of diverse plant fibers from fruit, vegetables, and nuts - as well as the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects produced with green leafy vegetables.

**Final Notes**

I know this seems like a lot of work, and for those of you who have severe anxiety or depression, I understand wholeheartedly how hard keeping up with this shit is. I’ve been through several cycles of diets, nootropics, addictions, and exercise phases, and I was never able to maintain it. I would always relapse to bad habits out of need for immediate comfort. That’s the bitch about depression and anxiety. You know what you need to do and you know what steps are required to make your life better, but you just can’t find the mental motivation to do it. I believe discipline is a muscle of consciousness and if you don’t exercise daily, it atrophies. If there is one nootropic that helps exercise this discipline muscle and maintain good habits, it’d be P21(with meditation). I’ve taken it on/off for just over a month now, and its effects on my mental willpower have been completely unmatched. I no longer sit and ruminate with procrastinating anxiety about all the shit I needed to do, I just fucking do it now because I know I’m investing in my future happiness and it'll be worth it long term(as cheesy as that sounds). Being content used to be my only goal in life, and now I realize how pointless that is. You need goals and struggle to reach those truly rewarding happy moments, everything can't be great all the time. So take 2 weeks and plan out every meal, supplement, meditation session, and exercise routine and follow it precisely. Just know that while you feel shitty and anxiety ridden right now, I can almost guarantee at the end of the 2 week mark you’ll feel better than you ever have and you'll want to continue some of the habits you've learned. If you fall back into depression, so be it, just learn something while you try to claw your way back out again. Eventually it'll come together. :)

/u/Guacamolium,308,2lb1dp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/2lb1dp/uguacamolium/,139,1415168953.0,"Unfortunately, I have some bad news. Jason (/u/Guacamolium), my business partner and co-founder of Ceretropic has died. He was found dead in his apartment on Friday afternoon. He had not come in for a few days, and was not answering his phone. I got a little worried, so /u/Synzael and I decided to go check on him. After he did not answer, we decided to get the police to come down. When they entered his apartment, they found him dead inside.

The toxicology screen will not be back for a few weeks. However, Jason had been having a few problems with Xanax and drinking. He was never one to be careful with his own safety, and would often have horrible insomnia. This led to him turning to Xanax and alcohol to try and get a little bit of sleep some nights. I let him know how irresponsible that was, but he never really got the message. There were a few occasions that I found him passed out after taking too much. I made him get into a substance abuse program, which he had been going to regularly. However, I never felt he was taking it seriously enough. I had hoped that he had things under control, but always feared that something would happen. I just figured it would be him getting in trouble, or driving on it and getting in an accident. I never expected the worst.

I know a lot of you spoke to Jason often about all manner of things. He was a very intelligent person, with a lot of great ideas. This is a big loss for Ceretropic, and the community as a whole. We would always have long sessions, where we would bounce new ideas off each other. Our personalities worked very well together for coming up with new compounds. He would always be sort of out there with optimism, and I would bring a healthy level of pragmatism to the equation; which led to a good creative environment. It's going to be very different without him around.

Anyone out there that has someone they know that is going through a tough time, please take the time to try and help them. **People in general, but especially us in the nootropic community, like to see ourselves as invincible. We never consider the possibility that one wrong measurement could be the end of us. I think this should be a wake up call for many of us out there being a little too cavalier with our safety. You never know what moment could be your last.** I wish I could have been a better friend to Jason, and possibly helped prevent this from happening. However, I know that hindsight is always 20/20. I hope that this incident can help us all to strive to be more careful with our safety, and reach out to those that we know need a little help. Jason was a very good guy, and he will be missed.

Ceretropic will continue to operate as normally as we can. Please bear with us for any delays in the coming weeks. ",2014-11-05 11:59:13

Theacrine - Not a mere Caffeine substitute,306,bdnsro,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/bdnsro/theacrine_not_a_mere_caffeine_substitute/,53,1555405341.0,"Theacrine, also known as 1,3,7,9-Methyluric Acid is a real buzz compound on r/nootropics. However, very little is yet known about Theacrine and few studies have been made. Many claims are made with few sources - in this post I will summarize studies on Theacrine to possibly elucidate some of its properties.

When searched for on Pubmed, Theacrine returns 25 results. A significant amount of these are regarding chemical reactions or plant synthesis routes. These will be ignored, as they are irrelevant.

Theacrine has locomotor-activating effects in rodent models, primarily through binding to Adenosine receptors. The study does however suggest that Theacrine might be directly acting through Dopamine receptors, as D1 and D2 antagonists block the increase in locomotion.^[1]

This is however misleading as not only do D1 and D2 antagonists decrease locomotion all on their own, blocking these receptors has also been shown to prevent locomotor activation in Caffeine-treated rats.^[2]

Indeed, Caffeine and other A1 antagonists have been shown to induce Dopamine release in the Nucleus Accumbens.^[3]

Thus while it cannot be completely ruled out that Theacrine binds to Dopamine receptors directly, it is exceedingly unlikely. The study, in proper context, suggests that Theacrine is solely an Adenosine receptor antagonist. This also seems to be the most logical conclusion to draw as of now.

Theacrine also exerts antagonistic effects in combination with Caffeine, several studies confirm that Theacrine potentiates Pentobarbital-induced sleep, as opposed to Caffeine which attenuates it.^[4][5]

In fact, Theacrine alone attenuates Caffeine-induced insomnia in rats and increases Adenosine content in the hippocampus of rats. Even further, Theacrine significantly reverses the decrease in Pentobarbital-induced sleeping time induced by selective A1 antagonist DPCPX and selective A2A antagonist SCH58261.^[5]

Thus Theacrine can not possibly have the same activity at Adenosine receptors as Caffeine, since they exert antagonistic effects in rats. I should also add here that Caffeine is most likely an inverse agonist at the A2aR.^[6]

Although we don't have conclusive evidence of this, I'd like to suggest that Theacrine is a partial agonist at Adenosine receptor sites. Additionally, the most exhaustive article on Theacrine available also suggests this possibility.^[7]

Additionally, unlike Caffeine, Theacrine exerts no effects on blood pressure or heartrate.^[8]

It can thus be deemed unlikely that Theacrine like Caffeine causes release of ACTH, Cortisol and Epinephrine, although no conclusive evidence exists as of yet.^[9] However it has been noted that Theacrine does not exert traditional thermogenic effects like Caffeine and Citrus Aurantium does.^[7]

Furthermore, Theacrine has demonstrated analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects in rat models.^[10]

This effect is not shared by Caffeine. As a layman I will suggest that Theacrine might have activity at the A3R, since it mediates widespread and significant inflammatory responses. However, there is no evidence of this perspective.^[11]

Theacrine also lowers serum cholesterol in human trials.^[12] Caffeine seems to exert a weak opposite effect, Coffee having been noted to increase serum LDL-Cholesterol.^[13]

Finally, Theacrine has no hazardous interactions with Caffeine in adult humans.^[14]

***TL;DR***

Theacrine is not an agonist of, nor does it bind to, any of the Dopamine receptors. It is most likely a partial agonist at Adenosine receptors or induces Adenosine release by other mechanisms, since it has opposite effects to Caffeine and Theobromine in rat studies utilizing Pentobarbital.

Theacrine is not thermogenic, it has positive effects on motivation and pain but will not burn fat any faster than placebo. It has strong antiinflammatory effects, however the significance of this is not yet known. It lowers total serum cholesterol levels.

I believe an important amount of posters in this subreddit GREATLY underestimate the placebo effect,308,44ncd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/44ncd7/i_believe_an_important_amount_of_posters_in_this/,164,1454904989.0,"I'll probably get downvoted into oblivion for saying this, but fuck it. It's my opinion and I need to express it:

I really think that a lot of people here underestimate the potency of the placebo effect. I see these threads about how l-theanine ""cured"" somebody's crippling anxiety, or how they used to be a loser but since taking piracetam all the sudden they are super smart and shit, and I cannot help but feel very skeptical towards such claims.

I know very well that a specific substance can work even if you don't ""feel"" anything. I also know that people have different brain chemistry, etc. 
But consider this:

People tend to think that they are immune to placebo, but that's simply not the case. Nobody is. Even the smartest person in the world can get fed an illusion. The placebo effect is very, **VERY** powerful and should definitely not be underestimated.

We would definitely benefit from more double-blind self-tests à la Gwern.


Therefore, unless you do rigorous double-blinded self-experiments to eliminate, or at the very least -limit- the possibility of placebo effect, please don't tell people how ""l-theanine **definitely** cured my anxiety !!!!1!!1"" and use words such as ""seems to"" and ""may have"" more often.",2016-02-08 09:46:29

Yet many of the reports are in conflict, and there is no consensus on the general efficacy of almost anything - this is because the missing half of the equation is you.


The medical field also suffers from this: its tools are blunt sledgehammers like benzos, tricyclics and SNRI/NDRIs that may fix 2-3 things while breaking two (often more) previously balanced systems. Even things as ubiquitous seeming as ADD, ADHD and Anxiety are being recognized as having many possible causes (and consequently, sub-types). 


There is little mystery as to how things like 5-HTP, Picamilon or Choline will impact ""the brain"". What's missing is the guide which will let people find out how they will impact THEIR brain. To solve this, we need to shift from substance-centric to neurochemistry-centric discussion. For now, I'm simply encouraging every user to do their own research.


In the future, I'd like to start with Serotonin / Dopamine / Norepinephrine and branch off into GABA, Glutamate, ACh, etc - threads for each, collecting symptoms, clusters, and how to narrow it down enough for accurate self-experimentation by adjusting one factor at a time without medical tests and equipment out of reach for most of us.

"A follow-up to ""Incredibly simple ADHD ""stack"". If you have ""cyclical"" ADHD symptoms, this could be the reason why""",309,aojy6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/aojy6q/a_followup_to_incredibly_simple_adhd_stack_if_you/,90,1549682062.0,"A month ago I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/a6it4n/incredibly_simple_adhd_stack_if_you_have_cyclical/) in this community, and it got quite a lot more attention than I ever thought it could. Well, now things are different. I've finally reached a conclusion regarding those ""supplements"".

The previous post contained a lot of research that took a long time to pull together. This one isn't quite as rigorous, but I am very confident in my solution.

**tldr;** Those supplements we're treating a symptom, rather than the source of the problem. I'm now on a Keto diet, I eat many eggs for choline, I take alpha GPC, and Theacrine **(new, not fully tested yet)**. I take about 2700mg of EPA and DHA combined per day. I don't think I've ever felt this sharp and energetic while being stable.

# Since then:

I didn't want to keep taking a bunch of B vitamins. The regime continued to work, but it didn't feel right. I stopped taking them and continued to experiment. I wanted to find something simple. Since then, things that I tried which had an effect:

**Glutamine** \- Strong energetic rush, stopped working after a while. Eventually made me feel worse.

**Betaine HCL** \- Really helped me feel awake. I began to consider that my energy levels were due to digestion issues

**TMG (Betaine Anhydrous)** \- Strong effect for a while, but tapered off.

The fact that Betaine HCL was so helpful pointed me towards digestion issues. ^(I also noticed that my stool was pale) \- a lack of bile production? Bile is produced in the liver. This finally pointed me in the right direction.

# The problem:

I suspect that the issues I was facing are two things. 1. **Insulin resistance**. 2. **Choline deficiency**.

Since discovering the TMG (Trimethylglycine) helped, I learned about tetra-methylglycine. Also known as Choline. Choline is incredibly important for a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, which is very important for focus. But not only that, it's a methyl donor. Many people in this community know about this but I was completely blind to it. **I was barely getting any choline in my diet**.

[Oregon state university has my favorite information page about choline.](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/choline) Here's a relevant quote:

>Men and women fed intravenously (IV) with solutions that contained adequate methionine and folate but lacked choline have been found to develop a condition called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)

And then later in that same section:

>The occurrence of NAFLD is usually associated with the co-presentation of metabolic disorders, including obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and hypertension, in subjects with metabolic syndrome.

At the same time, I realized that I felt my worst when eating carbs. Not just wheat, but rice as well. One night I ate a bunch of spaghetti and felt terrible for 3 days straight. I now realize that the symptoms I listed in the previous post are likely hypoglycemic episodes.

# The theory:

I had been on a vegan diet for a while, which (unless you're careful) makes it difficult to get your daily choline content. Choline is most easily obtained from meat products. Oregon state university's choline information page states the following:

>The recommended adequate intake (AI) of choline is set at 425 milligrams (mg)/day for women and 550 mg/day for men.

The B vitamins I had been taking earlier helped with methylation, which can reduce an individual's required choline intake. Choline is also used for methylation, meaning that I likely had more choline available to turn into acetylcholine.

Furthermore, the lack of choline likely caused-or worsened insulin resistance. This would explain why I could no longer eat carbs.

# The solution:

I adopted a ketogenic diet to deal with the insulin resistance, and within a week I felt amazing. There is a lot of science behind the keto diet and its effect on insulin, too much to get into here. If anyone is interested, I can link you to my favorite resources. This, **by far**, had the greatest effect.

I also eat 4 eggs a day to reach my daily choline content. Eggs are very keto-friendly and contain the most choline out of any food. But since this is r/Nootropics, I also found some success in pills.

# Nootropics:

* **Alpha-GPC:** Since I knew of the importance of choline, I looked into choline supplementation. I finally decided on some Alpha GPC and Uridine (made me feel worse), to increase Acetylcholine synthesis. [The nicotinic cholinergic system has a promise in the treatment of ADHD, and plays a big role in focus.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4487649/) It had a really positive effect.
* **Theacrine:** This is a new one, and not much information is available for it. I've been taking it for a few days, and I really like the effect. It goes really well with the Alpha-GPC. Long-term results are pending. **(warning, I bought this because of the hype. If it doesn't have the tolerance issues that caffeine has, it's well worth it for me. It's also a bit smoother than caffeine.)**
* **Omega-3s:** Standard thing to do, but I take high amounts of it. About 2700mg of EPA&DHA. This doesn't have any directly noticeable effects, but I do believe it's helping.
* **L-theanine:** At night, very helpful before sleeping.

There were quite a few of you who said that ""this is me"". If you experienced [any of these symptoms](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/a6it4n/incredibly_simple_adhd_stack_if_you_have_cyclical/), pay attention to how you react to carbs. Metabolic disorders in North America are on the rise, and that is often attributed to the ""Standard American Diet"". Hope you find the solutions you are looking for. Sometimes the best solutions are the simplest ones. Cheers.",2019-02-09 08:44:22

Background story: Ever since hitting puberty, I've experienced a great deal of anxiety, both generalized and social. I always knew something was just not right with me, only later to find out I have Asperger's. People with this condition tend to have some special interests they obsess over, and something I love researching/experimenting with is nootropics. My main goal was getting my anxiety and moods under control, and I've tried dozens and dozens of nootropics/vitamins/supplements for this reason. I've experimented with many other nootropics for memory/cognitive-enhancement/mental-sharpness, but for the sake of this post, I will talk about ones that have helped me with anxiety. I've noticed many subscribers of this subreddit also suffer from anxiety, and a calm mind is one of the best nootropics there is IMO. This community is awesome and has helped me a lot, so hopefully this post will help someone else! I rated each of them in terms of personal anxiety relief. Remember, what didn't work for me might work for you, and vice versa. I just realized halfway through writing this that its a really long post, so I'll break it up into a few parts instead for time purposes.

-Bacopa (7/10): My first nootropic experience, and it was a good one. I noticed acute effects of lowered anxiety, and over the course of a few months noticed increased memory. This amazing herb is subltle enough that I feel normal, but noticable enough that I felt less stress and anxiety. I didn't even realize how great it was until I got off of it, and started experienceing my usual increased anxiety. It wasnt like an acute ""Wow, I feel so calm"" feeling, more like a background calm. Like turning down the volume of anxiety a couple of notches. Looking back at it, the 6-7 months I used it I was in a much better place mentally.

-Theanine (2/10): I know this is very popular in this subreddit, but personally I felt no noticable effects from it. I've tried suntheanine, and a few other brands since it is pretty hyped on here and similar forums, but unfortunately I'm just personally a non-responder. I would recommend trying this if you suffer from anxiety, since many people find it helps them. 

-Phenibut(10/10): My holy grail of social anxiety relief. The first time I took it was absolutely mind blowing. I was about 17 working at a supermarket bagging groceries (LOL) and dealing with terrible anxiety, especially social anxiety; talking to customers all day made me very on edge all day and mentally drained at the end of the day. I tried a 1 gram dose of phenibut, and 4 hours later, I felt the best I have ever felt in my life. ""The world was my playground"" is quote from a fellow redditor that perfectly describes my experience with this substance. I was flirting with girls, hi-fiving everybody, and just felt fucking awesome. Like I just felt great to be alive, everyone felt like a good friend, and I was so charming/whitty/outgoing. Unfortunately as many of you already know, these effects are not sustainable with regular use and rebound anxiety is a bitch. Fortunately, this led me to research the mechanisms of action of phenibut and Gaba-B, which led to my discovery of the following substance.

-Baclofen(10/10): Not really a nootropic, but it felt identical to phenibut. Whats even better, I was able to take it regularly and keep the anxiety-reducing benefits of phenibut without the extreme tolerance and other side effects. I'm convinced I have some kind of gaba-B dysfuntion, because baclofen causes me to feel normal. I'm more comfortable in social situations, and its effects on empathy and mood have made this an absolute staple for me.

-Kava-Kava (6/10): First I tried cheap Kava, then was told I have to make my own kava from a good powder. My experiences were not that great: terrible taste, headaches, and groggyness were the main effects I got from this. Oh, and a slight anxiety reduction. I have read that kava has a reverse tolerance(meaning the longer you take it, the stronger the effects are). I want to continue experimenting with this though, because I dont believe I've taken it for long enough periods and maybe my quality of root was not that great.

-Picamilon(4/10): Another popular anxiety nootropic, unfortunately it didnt do much for me. I've read many people are not very impressed with it either, howevery YMMV.

-N-acetyl-cystine(9/10): This stuff is awesome, and is another staple for me. My experience with NAC is less intrusive thoughts, decrease in impulsiveness, and it literally CURED my trichtillomania. It also prevents hangovers for me when taken a couple of hours before a night out drinking with friends.

-Memantine (7/10): For the first few days, I felt amazing on it. I definitely felt an increased mood and decreased anxiety. Those effects subdued, and I was left with some mood stabilization and tolerance reduction to stimulants.

-Colouracetam(7/10): This is my favorite racetam. I feel an increase in mood and a nice, clear, calm mind. For some reason, Ceretropic's sublingual version is the only one that I feel noticable effects from. I will probably end up buying some bulk powder from them, because I'm thinking maybe I just got some bunk powder from the other vendor I tried.

-Noopept(6/10): This stuff has such a psychedelic vibe for me. An increase in colors and an appreciation for scenery (LOL) are the main effects I felt from it. It didnt do too much for my anxiety, but I did find taking it sublingually helped my verbal fluidity in social situations, so that definetly a plus.

-Aniracetam (6/10): This is a popular racetam that many users descibe as being anxiolytic. Besides the first few doses, it did not do too much for my anxiety personally. I even tried taking it with Omega-3 as someone suggested to me, and still nothing too noticeable. I may try this one again, maybe this time with a regular 3x daily dosage. The only effect that I really enjoyed was making music sound better, and that also faded after the first few doses.

-Phosphatidylserine (8/10): I know that the bovine sources are not used anymore for this supplement and other sources of it do not have very good research, but it made a pretty big impact as far as stress reduction for me. I felt less physical anxiety in social situations, and did not get as hot as I would during social interaction. Normally I would start sweating bullets, my voice would crack, and people who shook my hand would ask me why my palms were so sweaty. lol

I was initially going to write all my experiences but didnt realize how long this post became. This is only a fraction of my experiences, and I will write up the rest if anyone is interested. Off the top of my head, I have also tried bromantane, ashwaghanda, emoxypine, etifoxine, holy basil, low dose naltrexone, tianeptine, klonopin, semax, inositol, DMAE, galantamine, PEA, 5-HTP, gabapentin, rhodiola, kratom, L-tryptophan/tyrosine, and some others as well.

Recently there was a post about the relation between gut health and mental health, and it piqued my interest in creating a stack to help facilitate healing and microbriome regrowth. After diving into google scholar articles and acknowledging the relation between gut health and mental acuity, I'm convinced this is the best stack to assist with repairing your microbiome and gut health. I started a variation of this stack a couple months ago in addition to some other noots/peptides, and it's made some subtle but perceptible improvements in my life already. Hopefully it helps ya'll too. 


**Studies**

* [Stress & the gut-brain axis: Regulation by the microbiome](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352289516300509)
 * The gut microbiota has been implicated in a variety of stress-related conditions including anxiety, depression and irritable bowel syndrome, although this is largely based on animal studies or correlative analysis in patient populations.
 * Several lines of evidence support the suggestion that gut microbiota influence stress-related behaviours, including those relevant to anxiety and depression. Work using germ-free (GF) mice (i.e., delivered surgically and raised in sterile isolators with no microbial exposure) demonstrates a link between microbiota and anxiety-like behaviour (Neufeld et al., 2011; Diaz Heijtz et al., 2011 ;  Clarke et al., 2013). In particular, reduced anxiety-like behaviour in GF mice was shown in the light-dark box test and in the elevated plus maze (see (Luczynski et al., 2016a) for review). On the other hand, GF rats display the opposite phenotype, and are characterized by increased anxiety-like behaviour (Crumeyrolle-Arias et al., 2014). Interestingly, the transfer of stress-prone Balb/C microbiota to GF Swiss Webster (SW) mice has been shown to increase anxiety-related behaviour compared to normal SW mice, while transfer of SW microbiota to GF Balb/C mice reduced anxiety-related behaviour compared to normal Balb/C mice suggesting a direct role for microbiota composition in behaviour (Bercik et al., 201
 * Gene expression within the hippocampus also is markedly different in GF mice compared to normal controls. The hippocampus exerts strong control over the HPA stress axis, and GF mice are characterized by markedly increased hippocampal 5-HT concentrations (Clarke et al., 2013), accompanied by decreased 5-HT1A receptor gene expression in the dentate gyrus in female (but not male) GF mice (Neufeld et al., 2011). Intriguingly, other CNS alterations in GF mice also are sex-dependent; e.g., altered expression of BDNF has been documented only in male GF mice (Clarke et al., 2013). BDNF is an important plasticity-related protein that promotes neuronal growth, development and survival, with key roles in learning, memory and mood regulation. BDNF gene expression is lower in the cortex and amygdala in male GF mice compared with controls (Diaz Heijtz et al., 2011), whereas hippocampal BDNF levels in GF mice have been reported to either increase (Neufeld et al., 2011) or decrease (Diaz Heijtz et al., 2011; Clarke et al., 2013 ;  Sudo et al., 2004).
 * Therefore, gut microbiota may play a crucial role in tryptophan availability and metabolism to consequently impact central 5-HT concentrations. Although the specific mechanisms underlying this putative modulatory interaction are unknown, they are potentially mediated indirectly through an immune-related mechanism linked to microbial colonization

 * Significant progress has been made over the past decade in
recognizing the importance of gut microbiota to brain
function. Key findings show that stress influences the
composition of the gut microbiota and that bidirectional
communication between microbiota and the CNS influences
stress reactivity. Several studies have shown that
microbiota influence behavior and that immune challenges
that influence anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors are
associated with alterations in microbiota. Emerging work
notes that alterations in microbiota modulate plasticityrelated,
serotonergic, and GABAergic signaling systems in
the CNS. Going forward, there is a significant opportunity
to consider how the gut–brain axis and, in particular, new
tools will allow researchers to understand how dysbiosis of
the microbiome influences mental illness.


* [A randomized controlled trial to test the effect of multispecies probiotics on cognitive reactivity to sad mood](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159115000884)
 *  We found that a 4-week multispecies probiotic intervention reduced self-reported cognitive reactivity to sad mood, as indexed by the LEIDS-r (van der Does and Williams, 2003; van der Does, 2005 ;  Kruijt et al., 2013). Further analyses showed that the strongest beneficial effects were observed for the aggression and rumination subscales, indicating that in the probiotics supplementation condition participants perceived themselves to be less distracted by aggressive and ruminative thoughts when in a sad mood.

**Forgot to mention EDIT:** For those of you who eat a lot of bad food, be aware of a possible Herxheimer reaction if cutting a lot of sugar/carbs in conjunction with this stack. A year ago, I went hard into keto after being on a very high sugar/high carb diet, and I had what is typically called ""the keto flu"", but I believe this effect is more due to the massive die off of bacteria in your gut that feeds on sugars and carbs. I've had a few friends try this similar stack(high sugar diets), and have a ""sick"" couple of days in the beginning even though they only cut back on some sugary stuff. Light migraine, sore throat/tonsils, and general fatigue. Feels like a 100% manageable flu, but it's still unpleasant. Anti-inflammatory supplements help with this but only so much. This typically lasts a day or two. 


**FINAL EDIT Summary:** 

I think this stack covers a large majority of the bases required to propagate gut flora and increase general intestinal health, while providing nootropic benefits in relation to social fluidity, mood, mental energy, and emotional health. Starting with the probiotic, I chose Garden of Life(100 Billion CFU) for a variety of reasons. First it has all the popular beneficial strains, in addition to a diverse amount of subtly mood boosting strains. After doing some googling, it looks like there is a decent balance between the histamine increasing/reducing, the immuno-modulator, nutrient absorption promoting, mood boosting, anti inflammatory, and  stool improving strains. Taking GOL in addition to the prebiotic strain from Vitamin Shoppe provides all the prebiotic goodness to help facilitate the beneficial flora to grow and actually populate the gut long term. 


Glutamine, NAG, Quercetin, Collagen, and Aloe Vera juice all help grow the intestinal mucosa back to its normal state, and regrow the Microvillus that gets damaged with chronic bowel disease. For the good bacteria to stick around long term, it needs that mucous layer for protection. Another important factor that most people overlook in gut health is digestive enzymes. Certain strains of bacteria can change the acidity of your stomach and intestines, which can cause all sorts of problems with digestive effectiveness and as a result, your nutrient absorption. Super enzymes are a staple in any one of my stacks, simply because you can never digest food too well, right? The last 3 supplements are Caprylic Acid/Coconut Oil, Omega 3s, and Vitamin D. Omega 3s and Coconut oil both assist with Butyrate production, which provides tremendous benefits with ""how you feel"" via its anti-inflammatory action. It also helps with weight loss and insulin sensitivity. Vitamin D is also a general fix all and something everyone should be taking. Unless you work outside for a large majority of your day, you're probably not getting enough vitamin D. 4000IU is the recommended daily allowance, so 5000IU should be fine for everyone. Vitamin D is also essential for gene functions that pertain gut flora, as well as anti-inflammatory pathways regulated via the VDR receptors. Hopefully this helps you folks with gut problems get back to guaranteed regularity, it's certainly helped me.

"Zinc, Magnesium, Vitamin B6, Iron and Vitamin C may play a prominent role in ADHD.",294,ae8m21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/ae8m21/zinc_magnesium_vitamin_b6_iron_and_vitamin_c_may/,96,1547081004.0,"[Micronutrient Deficiencies in ADHD: A Global Research Consensus](https://isom.ca/article/micronutrient-deficiencies-adhd-global-research-consensus/)

&#x200B;

Summary:  Mineral deficiencies may play a prominent role in the pathophysiology of ADHD. Magnesium, zinc, copper, iron, and Vitamin B6 appear to have substantial effects on ADHD symptoms. 

&#x200B;

**Zinc** 

Zinc deficiency represents one of the most-recognized micronutrient deficiencies linked to ADHD symptoms. With key roles in enzyme activation and neurotransmitter synthesis, zinc is critical for regulation of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). 

**Vitamin B6**

In addition to supporting magnesium metabolism, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), as pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), has independently essential roles in the nervous system, energy production, neurotransmitter synthesis, heme production, and is critical for strong immune function and the inflammatory response (Ho et al., 2016; Rucklidge et al., 2017; Ueland et al., 2017).

**Iron**

At appropriate concentrations, iron is another essential cofactor in the enzymatic production of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine (Rucklidge et al., 2017). Most reliably assessed by serum ferritin, low iron status is a significant but heterogeneous risk factor for ADHD.

**Magnesium**

Possibly the most crucial micronutrient for optimal brain performance, magnesium participates in virtually all enzyme reactions, nerve signal conduction, and in the function of dopamine and serotonin receptors. Magnesium also plays a key role in the excitation status of nerves through inhibition of excitatory glutamate receptors and promotion of GABA reception (Greenblatt, 2017). Deficiency of magnesium is identified in almost all cases of ADHD, and is widespread even in healthy populations (Moshfegh, A. et al., 2009).

**Vitamin C**

Vitamin C is a critical component of the antioxidant system. Heightened oxidative stress caused by chronic inflammation, heavy metal or other environmental exposures, and hyperexcited neurons place heavy demands on the brain’s antioxidant system. ",2019-01-10 06:13:24

If you have ever **hated having to pay for journal articles** then read on.

Many of these articles can be found for free.

[1] **Google Scholar** - https://scholar.google.com/

   The ""advance search"" option (drop-down on the right side) helps find articles by title, author, publications and by publication date.

[2] Free JSTOR account - http://www.jstor.org/

   This gives you 3 articles a month for free.  I list this below google scholar because there are no questions about copyright and legality.  I PERSONALLY NEVER USE THIS as Canada has better copyright laws than most so it is not worth the trouble.

[3] Reddit Scholar - https://www.reddit.com/r/Scholar/

   This is a great place to ask someone else to do the work for you.  Again, I find it easier to get the stuff myself.  Mostly I learned how through /r/scholar

[4] Libgen - http://libgen.io/scimag/

  **This is magic** Go to Libgen.  Search for a subject.  Download free PDF.  You don’e even have to know the author or proper title. For example, a search on “caffeine” gives me the first 100 results (telling me I should be more specific to get exactly what I want).  A search for [lions mane](http://libgen.io/scimag/?s=lion%27s+mane&journalid=&v=&i=&p=&redirect=1) gives me 21 results including a review by the title [Chemistry, Nutrition, and Health-Promoting Properties of Hericium erinaceus {Lion’s Mane} Mushroom Fruiting Bodies and Mycelia and Their Bioactive Compounds](http://cyber.sci-hub.bz/MTAuMTAyMS9hY3MuamFmYy41YjAyOTE0/10.1021%40acs.jafc.5b02914.pdf).

 **Note that many Libgen articles are downloaded from Sch-Hub**.  If the libgen servers are busy, you often get redirected to Sci-Hub for your search.

[5] Sci-Hub - http://sci-hub.io/

   The [wiki on Sci-Hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub) says

>Sci-Hub is a website with over 62 million academic papers and articles available for direct download. **It bypasses publisher paywalls by allowing access through educational institution proxies.** Sci-Hub stores papers in its own repository, and additionally the papers downloaded by Sci-Hub are also stored in Library Genesis (LibGen).


Sometimes when searching on Sci-Hub you get this message

>search temporarily unavailable, please use DOI or direct links

>If you're using Google chrome, you can install Sci-Hub extension to use search.
To do this: . . . 

They give a download link for a google chrome extension - click, unzip and install.

Sci-Hub does not work every time as publishers are always working against them, but it has every paper you want.

EDIT:

/u/jminuse gives a good caution to **look for review articles** when you are new to a subject.  Also, if there are multiple reviews don't forget to read the most recent one.

ALSO - **Never draw conclusions from one study.**

For example a google scholar search of [bacopa review](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=bacopa+review) is a much better starting place than just random searching. (still over 7600 found)

Searching the [same with LibGen](http://libgen.io/scimag/?s=bacopa+review&journalid=&v=&i=&p=&redirect=1) gives 5 results that are exactly what I was looking for.

In the summer of 2012, I was returning to school, eager to get ahead, and came across [this post](http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/36691-ten-months-of-research-condensed-a-total-newbies-guide-to-nootropics/) after doing a cursory search for 'smart drugs.' With that, my journey into the world of nootropics began.


I don't necessarily want to do a review of every substance I've tried so much as offer some insights over what I've observed, both within myself and the community these past few years.

1) **Like any community, the nootropics scene periodically undergoes trends, fads and changing consensuses.** When I first began frequenting Longecity and /r/nootropics, the general consensus was the -racetams (so long as you were a responder) represented the best risk/reward available, modafinil was the closest thing to a real world 'Limitless' drug, and a handful of other substances (e.g., pyritinol, bacopa, ALCAR, etc.) were of varying benefit. Fast forward a year or so and hype around CILTEP reached fever pitch, only to be thoroughly debunked by a popular post here. At some point in between, phenylpiracetam became more widespread at economical prices (for awhile, its high cost was a barrier), tianeptine rose from an obscure antidepressant to one of the more well-known nootropics, and uridine+DHA+choline was regarded by some as one of the best longer-term stacks. Later still, Semax, Selank et al. became household names, risk tolerances transitioned markedly from demanding a near absence of side effects to an overarching willingness to experiment with research chemicals holding little-to-no human safety evidence, and the downsides of phenibut became thoroughly entrenched in popular opinion. 3 years from now, I wouldn't be surprised if the popular discourse had changed further still.

**2) Anecdotally, I've found the best nootropics tend to be Russian.** I'm not sure whether it's arisen from a need for solutions to the resulting bran damage that high incidences of alcoholism inflicts, a scientific community more willing to pursue treatments intended to improve rather than simply treat, or something else endogenous to the culture, but invariably, my best experiences have come from Russian nootropics - e.g., phenylpiracetam, Semax, bromantane and to a lesser extent, Noopept.

**3) My responses to various substances have evolved over time.** When I first took piracetam, I felt a sense of immense clear-headedness. Now I'm lucky if I even remember taking it halfway through the day, and question whether it grants anything beyond placebo. (Evidence of benefit among healthy samples essentially boils down to a single study from the 70's; see [here](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00426834).) Likewise, various adaptogens were godsends for my focus, energy and alertness; now, I hardly feel much of anything from the likes of ginkgo, ginseng, rhodiola, etc. Targeting micronutrient deficiencies might be at play here; unbeknownst to me at the time, I was fairly deficient in both vitamin D and B12 during my introduction to nootropics. Later lab tests uncovered both, and subsequent supplementation fixed a good deal of issues I had in terms of energy and sleep, yet coincided with a change in response to components of my stack.

**4) The often-discussed U-shaped response curve applies to nearly everything.** I recently read a post of someone complaining that this forum is excessively indulgent in prescribing exercise as the cure-all for everything, and that he had been doing so regularly and strenuously for the past few years with little in the way of benefits. Likely true. What else is true, though, especially across the current literature, is there is such a thing as both too little and too much exercise  (see [1](http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleID=2108914)). Similarly, while the health food world is awash in kale-love, overconsumption might end up exposing oneself to high levels of thallium (see [2](http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2015/07/kale-silent-killer)). The same can be said for excessive reliance on stimulants, high levels of supplemental antioxidants, etc. On the other hand, the benefits of quality aerobic, strength and HIIT-based workouts is insane when dosed appropriately, and has led to more personal benefits than anything else outside the concurrent use of a few select stimulants, Russian compounds, meditation and diet. In earlier times, I was on the extreme end of the spectrum when I reached a semi-elite amateur level in competitive endurance sports - and had little to show in terms of cognitive fluidity.

**5) Simple stacks are often best; distilling a stack down to its most effective components is underrated.** People (ideally) tend to transition across three stages in their nootropics journey: i) dipping one's feet in the water with a few 'starter' nootropics, e.g., caffeine + theaine, piracetam + ALCAR, etc.; ii) an aggressive experimentation phase where the aim is to figure out what works in a swift manner; and iii) a return to the basics once one determines what personally benefits them. Far too often, I read reports where someone has tried whatever the current research chemical du-jour is and writes a glowing report after < 1 week's usage, only to detail that they also take a plethora of other RC's, a few prescriptions and possibly occasional dips into pyschoactive, non-nootropic compounds. Such reports, IMO, are completely bogus with the amount of confounding factors present. The reality that doesn't get acknowledged often enough is we often have little-to-no data on long-term outcomes for even the classic nootropics, let alone combinations of such. The last place you want to be is taking 12 different things, have a debilitating side effect creep in and not have any idea where it's arising from.

**6) At some point, you have to really ask yourself about personal risk tolerances.** I think a general consensus around here is the willingness to trade long-term uncertainty for short-to-mid-term benefits. The question is, at what point does the trade-off begin to lose value? For example, could you tolerate persistent paresthesia, tinnitus, etc., if it meant improving cognition, improving anxiety, removing depression, etc.? How about a trade-off in working memory if it meant being able to memorize things photographically, perhaps to the point where you forgot what your manager just said seconds after walking away? Oftentimes, free lunches are tough to find in the world of homeostasis.

**7) Figure out your lowest-hanging fruit and target that first.** For me, figuring out a deficiency in B12 and D were godsends. Later, figuring out that I had polymorphisms at the SNP level signaling a lifelong greater need for said vitamins was enlightening as to why I became deficient in the first place despite abundant sunlight and animal product consumption. Likewise, going from a few weeks of near-complete sedentary work to 3-4 days of cardio and strength training has swift, dramatic effects on my rapidity of thought, ability to internalize technical subjects, and general mood/outlook.

**8) Know thyself - otherwise, it's easy to get caught up on others' glowing reports.** A perfect example would be tianeptine - invariably, a handful of people with debilitating depression have found immense benefits and few downsides given appropriate dosages. Said people have gone on to write glowing reports when the subject comes up. Myself, being the curious mind that I am, read such reports and decide I might like to experience said benefits myself - while momentarily neglecting that I have neither clinical depression nor the same brain chemistry as those whose posts I'm reading. Conversely, I find that nootropics that are popular among the ADHD crowd tend to have disproportionately positive effects - e.g., uridine+DHA+choline, Semax, etc. Yet modafinil is occasionally touted for its concentration-enhancing effects, and I've personally found it to be almost anti-nootropic in that I have an abundance of wakefulness but lose out on creativity, problem-solving skills and attention to detail.

**9) Some of the best nootropics are often not things you can find in a pill.** For example, when I had regular access to a sauna, I found the combination of hot and cold exposure to be immensely beneficial both for focus and sleep. When I'm in areas where natural settings are readily accessible, a few hours spent hiking leaves me thoroughly able to write well after. When I take a weekend sabbatical from smart devices, laptops, etc., I find my ability to sit down and be productive on a single task, like reading a demanding book, skyrockets. 

**10) Take breaks from time to time.** Nootropics, when they work, are awesome. Knowing your baseline is equally awesome. Saving money, even more so. Even with everything I've experimented with, I've found one of the most effective things in terms of boosting mood, productivity, rapidity of thought, etc. is strong espresso (and when the jitters arrive, a dash of theanine) after taking 3-4 weeks completely off caffeine. My response under such a scenario is almost to the point where if I could gain said benefits without the tolerance that comes from consistent use, I'd need little else. Invariably, the benefits begin decreasing after a week or so of use, and by week 3 or 4 of daily caffeine intake, the need to up dosages simply for the wakefulness aspect becomes a near-necessity. Breaks and their resultant tolerance reduction are awesome, though often highly inconvenient given a demanding work/academic schedule. When you have the chance, though, don't discount the utility of time away from the pill cabinet.",2015-08-17 11:09:36
"Toxoplasma Gondii is a very common brain parasite that has been implicated in a range of mental disorders and lower intelligence. Has somebody tested positive, got cured and perceived a change?",290,a0l02e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/a0l02e/toxoplasma_gondii_is_a_very_common_brain_parasite/,159,1543279655.0,"Toxoplasma Gondii is a brain parasite that can infects all warm blooded animals and reproduces through the digestive system of cats.

&#x200B;

Higher incidence of Toxoplasma Gondii has been found in [suicide completers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3128543/), [schizophrenic patients](https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article-abstract/38/3/642/1867672) and [bipolar disorder sufferers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322312000108). Toxoplasma Gondii is typically said to be asymptomatic in immunocompetent infected hosts and remains latent for its lifetime.

&#x200B;

Since this ""asymptomatic"" infection has been shown to be linked to [neurotransmitters imbalances](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395614002866) that could impair one's thinking process, I was wondering if somebody got cured and noticed a difference. The treatment usually involves a several month long course of combined antibiotics.

&#x200B;

The infection is very common, as in half of French, German and Belgian people are infected. Incidence in the US is lower at around 15%.

Source for the [lower intelligence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12853170) mentioned in the title.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Many people have mentioned that there is no cure. There are actually a large number of publications where patients that test positive initially can test again negative after a long-term treatment. They are summarized [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138204#sec021) (full citation below).

"Alright I'm fully convinced, gut microbiome and inflammation is DIRECTLY linked to depression/dysthymia. I just had got over a horrible case of giardia and experienced 180 degree flips in mood, energy, motivation.",283,9ssjnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/9ssjnr/alright_im_fully_convinced_gut_microbiome_and/,161,1540965560.0,"Picked up Giardia when I was on the CDT this year. Had just finished Colorado and was on the last 700ish miles to go. Was feeling great, energized, excited to finish another thru-hike, doing 30-35miles a day. Then bam giardia hit and I started shitting and vomiting everything I ate or drank. Went from 178lbs to 163lbs in a matter of two weeks. I wasn't even able to keep water down and became extremely dehydrated in the first 4 days.

&#x200B;

I've suspected that the gut microbiome has played a large part in my fatigue and depression but getting giardia has convinced me beyond any doubt. It apparently likes to feed on glucose so you're not supposed to eat sugar. I didn't realize this in the first few days and tried to drink gatorades and eat ice-cream to get any sort of calories in my body. I noticed that immediately after ingesting the sugar, one I would very often throw up, but also my joints would flare up with pain. After almost 1,900 miles hiked my body was holding up surprisingly well and were mostly pain free but immediately after eating sugars they would all flare up with pain, which was a signal of inflammation. So the inflammation in my gut was carrying over to inflammation in the rest of the body.

&#x200B;

Well it got so bad I got off trail and came home. On trail I was really looking forward to coming home so I could relax, watch movies, and play video games. But when I actually got home for the life of me I couldn't get into ANY games or movies. They all had zero fun. I didn't want to do anything. Nothing was interesting or fun. Classic depression. 

&#x200B;

I wrote it off to being sick but even after I started to recover and put some weight back on the dysthymia stayed. It was only in the last few days when I've made a concerted effort to eliminate all sugar and get in loads of fiber from lentils and other veggies and also megadosing a probiotic that's worked well for me in the past that I've felt better. And the change has been overnight. Two days ago I was still feeling depressed and had no interest in anything. Today I had so much energy and motivation I went to the gym and am really getting into Path of Exile. 

&#x200B;

Oh another weird and interesting side-effect. I have HORRIBLE seasonal allergies which have only gotten worse as I've gotten older. In the last 5 years I have to blow my nose for an hour after waking up even in the dead of winter. Oddly when I had giardia I had zero sinus issues and even now my sinuses have been much more clear then they used to be. So it appears that my allergies are linked to my gut microbiome and whatever was causing it has been flushed out of my system. 

&#x200B;

Just wanted to share. If you suffer from a general malaise, lack of energy, lack of motivation, lack of interest in things you used to find interesting you might want to take a look at your diet and try some probiotics. I always knew that when I ""ate better"" I felt better but generally linked that to having more nutrients and less carbs thus less insulin response. Now I wonder if the true mechanism is more to do with whether you're feeding the ""good"" bacteria in your gut and starving the ""bad"" when you ""eat better"" rather than how your body handles the macronutrient content. Probably a mixture of both but I think the effect of the microbiome needs a lot more attention then we give it. ",2018-10-31 11:29:20

Hey guys,

Funny that the news of a few purity issues with some of our common suppliers is coming out at this time.

I have been working(with a few others) on **creating a lab testing service** to help benefit our community.

&#x200B;

Our ""organization"" has acquired many analytical chemistry tools for testing nootropics.

**Our inventory right now is** :

FTIR, UV/Vis, Raman Spectrometer

Melting point apparatus

TLC Places

Plenty of solvents

Reagents for heavy metal testing methods..

&#x200B;

I would like to open this resource as a **non-profit** in hope of **increasing safety** and fact checking around these parts. In addition I would like to see some people step forward to help lead this effort as I want this not to be my own project but a **community effort**.

&#x200B;

Our current website is:

[http://homebrewbio.tech](http://homebrewbio.tech)

&#x200B;

The services we offer right now are limited to identification of chemicals and purity testing(by beers law). In the coming weeks we will be **adding heavy metal testing.**

&#x200B;

I would like to hopefully open up the site to a **free sample testing program** (that has a wait list) and a **fast track program** that is **affordable**. I don't plan to make any profits from this site but hope that funds collected can go to getting more advanced equipment and supplies for methods..

 It was tough at first and I found myself gasping for air and taking frequent breaks, but I persevered and after a couple weeks I started getting in better shape. I was amazed at how damn good I felt after cycling for 30 minutes to an hour. I get some euphoria, my mind speeds up and I obtain a clear headedness that beats any nootropic I've tried.

During the day, computer screens look good—they're designed to look like the sun. But, at 9PM, 10PM, or 3AM, you probably shouldn't be looking at the sun.

f.lux fixes this: it makes the color of your computer's display adapt to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day.

It's even possible that you're staying up too late because of your computer. You could use f.lux because it makes you sleep better, or you could just use it just because it makes your screen look better.

I have  dealt with anhedonia for over 12 years, likely longer.  I can't even remember the last time I felt joy.  I never really thought I was depressed, because I'm still a high functioning very productive person.  I never went to the doctor for feelings of depression for multiple reasons.  I have a great life, great job, terrific family, and my wife is the love of my life . . . . . . . just absolutely no joy.  I couldn't anticipate it.  I have had a pituitary adenoma for over 25 years (prolactinoma).  Rather large one that has responded to dostinex, but my prolactin levels are still much too high for a typical male.  No other side affects of the condition other than occasional headaches that I can tell, but I'm sure it's possible even likely to have affected my hormonal balance.  Dostinex is a dopamine agonist so I'm sure that is also playing a factor in all of this.  I started taking Lion's Mane  (2 weeks ago) on a whim with niacin as a result of hearing Paul Stamets.  The first week I noticed that I could think clearer, and that I was able to cope a little better with life.  I've always been a very critical person when it comes to small irritants.  Things like little messes around the house or illogical actions.  It would take everything within me not to speak critically or chastise someone for something they did.  Now I was able to brush it off, and take care of the small irritant myself.  That's weird . . . . . . REALLY weird.  Now at the end of week 2, and I am overwhelmed.  I went for a walk with my wife today and proclaimed that I could actually feel the wind on my face.  No, you don't get it.  I can FEEL the wind on my face.  The sun was shining, a breeze was blowing, the birds were singing.  I can't even describe it.  I actually called my mom last night.  That doesn't happen!  I talked to her for 2 hours!  Do you know how hard it is to sleep when you're feeling joy for the first time in a decade?  2 decades????  I had to get out of bed because I kept crying in my sleep thinking about my kids.  I feel like being interviewed on Oprah.  This is unreal.

It's been another week, and though the exuberance has subsided I am still feeling the positive affects of the LM/Niacin.  I really notice it when I do something new or go somewhere I haven't been for a while.  I visited my folks yesterday and when i walked into their house which I have done many times, I absolutely noticed the difference.  Everything was sharper and the lighting, though dim, seemed to have more energy.  It's like going from life with a 3 color palette to a 12 color palette.  We had a very lengthy conversation and I shared much of what I have been dealing with for the last 12 years.  It was wonderful.  I hadn't had a long personal conversation with them since I don't know when.  All because of the peace and joy that I now have.  They definitely noticed the change.  Needless to say after many hours of talking into the night, we hugged and I broke down in tears because of how happy I was to finally connect with them again.  We've always had a good relationship, but due to the state that I have been in for so long, I have harbored resentment and frustration.  I just couldn't figure out why no one could understand me.  I now have so much peace.  I love talking about deep and difficult topics, but now I can do it with much more grace.  It's great to still be feeling better and even better when others see it in you.",2019-04-06 23:57:36
"Do NOT use BPC-157 eye drops, you might go blind permanently: It induces angiogenesis, which can cause retinal bleeding",277,9whhnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/9whhnq/do_not_use_bpc157_eye_drops_you_might_go_blind/,122,1542081472.0,"Angiogenesis, induced by BPC-157, is very useful for wound/injury healing, but in excess associated with worsened outcomes in diseases like cancer. This is known, though, and mostly obvious that people with cancer should not use BPC-157.

I have recently seen here people discussing whether it is safe or not to use BPC-157 eye drops. While there are no specific studies about it, it's important to remember BPC-157 is a very direct inducer of angiogenesis, and when it is applied locally to the eye it might cause excessive angiogenesis there that it wouldn't cause with other routes of administration.

Excessive angiogenesis in the eye can cause bleeding in the retina, which can lead to permanent, partial or complete, blindness^[[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12597922) . This is a known issue with diabetes (diabetic retinopathy).

This is much less of a concern, if any at all, when BPC-157 is administered orally or by a Sub-Q injection, since it shouldn't reach the eye in any significant concentrations to matter. However, personally, I'd still surely stay away from BPC-157 if I had a diagnosed eye disease related to excessive angiogenesis.",2018-11-13 09:27:52

ALCAR (Acetyl L-Carnitine) and the NMDA receptor; Memory problems and Marijuana abuse,269,a1xpx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/a1xpx2/alcar_acetyl_lcarnitine_and_the_nmda_receptor/,86,1543649593.0,"I've just discovered some information that I think is valuable enough to share, specifically if you are concerned about the memory problems you're experiencing due to chronic marijuana use/abuse. The mechanism by which chronic marijuana use causes memory problems is the internalization of the CB1 receptor, the same mechanism which causes tolerance to marijuana in the first place. When the CB1 receptor is internalized into the cell, other receptors associated with it will follow, most notably the NMDA receptor, and while these receptors are in the cell they are unable to carry out functions associated with their activation (These are proven and real effects, read more here https://examine.com/nutrition/the-unbiased-truth-about-marijuana/). When it comes to memory problems, this internalization of the NMDA receptor is extremely important. It is known that there is an overall decrease in NMDA receptors as people age, and lower NMDA receptor levels have been implicated in hindering memory function, learning ability, and synaptic plasticity (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3703758/). NMDA receptor dysfunction/loss is found to a high degree in Alzheimer's patients.

Here's where the role of Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR) comes in. I found several studies that document an increase in NMDA receptors in the brain following ALCAR treatments. 
>Acute i.p. administration of Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR), a component of several biological systems, has been found to modify spontaneous and evoked electrocortical activity in young rats, and, in the old rats, to improve learning ability and to **increase the number of NMDA receptors in the whole brain.**

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7969747/

>Aging is associated with a reduction in the maximal density of NMDA-sensitive glutamate binding sites in rat hippocampus. This reduction is attenuated after long-term administration with L-acetylcarnitine (10 mg/Kg i.p. once a day for 4 months)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/2557734/?i=3&from=/7969747/related

Now, if you're like me and you find yourself addicted to lots of weed (or maybe you smoke every day but you can stop whenever you want, whatever), and you're starting to experience undeniable and unignorable memory deficits, this data seems to indicate that ALCAR can solve the memory issues caused by NMDA receptor internalization, by either increasing total number of NMDA receptors, attenuating their decline caused by excessive marijuana use, or both. I'm interested to see feedback on this information, personally I've been taking ALCAR for a few days and aside from the increases in attention and energy I'm seeing a noticable benefit in long and short term memory, the latter of which has seen a much more drastic increase, while cutting my marijuana consumption by about a third.",2018-12-01 13:03:13

 Kratom is a similar substance. It hits the mu-opioid receptors. Hundreds of thousands if not millions of people rely on it everyday just like they do on tianeptine. Personally I notice very little difference between these two substances except for the duration of effect. Ceretropics sulphate version is longer.

Sulbutiamine gave me kidney damage,259,bs0d75,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/bs0d75/sulbutiamine_gave_me_kidney_damage/,120,1558628680.0,"This is a warning for people out there that plan on taking sulbutiamine or are taking it currently. 

TL;DR : After using reddit thread to get advice on dosages I went to the doctor who told me that the amount of sulbutiamine that I was taking was causing poor kidney function and possibly damage. 

I started taking it 4 weeks ago and didn’t notice much difference after the first 2 weeks, so I went to the trusty old nootropics reddit page and found a popular thread that talks about Sulbutiamine Euphoria. 

Some people on this thread recommend taking doses well above 600mg which is often said to be the maximum — recommended dosages on this thread go into the grams, not just milligrams. I ended up taking 1g on 3 occasions over the past two weeks along with regular 200mg doses every day. 

Well, yesterday after a trip to my doctor and a blood test it was revealed to me that I had very poor kidney function. This was surprising to me as I am generally healthy, don’t drink very much alcohol, and don’t have any other problems / take anything that could be causing poor kidney function. When the doctor asked if I had been taking anything I told her fish oil and sulbutiamine — this is all I have been taking. 

The doctor told me that sulbutiamine is very hard on the kidneys at high doses and that I should stay far away from anything over 600mg. 

Just a little warning: don’t trust all the reddit doctors out there, and just because there is a large thread with many people saying that you should take large dosages of something doesn’t mean you should or that it will be good for your body. Nootropics can be effective but can also be quite harmful if not taken correctly. Be careful.

Edit: I really didn’t think that 1g 3 times would have such a large effect but it did. Even after doing my own research. Just goes to show everybody’s body is different and will react differently. Yes reddit is a good place to get basic ideas, but you should definitely further your understanding before actually applying them and even then you can get side effects.",2019-05-23 21:54:40

Threats from Brainstorm Nootropics / PowerFocus,249,4nnf61,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/4nnf61/threats_from_brainstorm_nootropics_powerfocus/,94,1465710515.0,"Some of you may have seen the new vendor post about a week ago for a new product called PowerFocus, from Brainpower Nootropics . The owner has deleted it now, but you can see the comments in the link below; minus the comments from the owner, which have either been edited or deleted.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/4m6mpf/feedback_on_this_nootropic/

Now many of you know that I can be very critical of new companies that pop up with unfounded claims, over the top marketing, fake reviews, no purity testing, dangerous ingredients, etc. Lately others have been starting to jump in and question things too, which is a good thing. It shows that people are starting to push for higher standards in the industry. Admittedly, I can be a bit direct in some of my criticisms. Some may even call me an asshole. However, I do it because I care about the community and the people in it. The fact that it seems like a new company selling a nootropic stack pops up every week, makes these criticisms more frequent. I want this community to be safer, grow, and advance. New vendors creating quality products, doing proper testing, and not over-marketing the shit out of things, is the way to do that. We have some really good vendors, that bring out novel quality products, and treat safety the way it should be treated. But like any other growing industry, we have a ton of people getting into it just to make money. Those are the ones that need to be called out.

Now to the direct issue of Brainpower Nootropics/PowerFocus. Their stack was called out by a few people for a number of reasons. The most glaring of them is the fact that they claim to have almost 3 grams powders per serving, but you cannot physically fit that amount into two 00 capsules. Anybody that works with 00 capsules can immediately know something is up with those numbers. They also did not know what a COA was when asked, along with a few other issues. All very valid things to call a vendor out on. The big issue, and the reason I made this post, is that after those criticisms were raised, the owner of the company decided to threaten me with retribution if I did not delete my comments. This is a very serious issue, and needs to be addressed.

I've been threatened a few times now by other vendors, and some have even followed through on those threats, and have caused issues for me. It happens to me a lot because of how vocal I am about ridiculous things I see, and the fact that I am an easier target to lash out at. However, nobody should fear retribution from vendors for calling them out on things they see wrong. Vendors threatening any members of this community is unacceptable, but it is more common than many think. Other moderators have been threatened. Other Redditors have as well. It something that needs to be addressed. I'll provide evidence of Brainpower Nootropics/PowerFocus's threats below, along with evidence of him following through with those threats.

[Here is the email we received from the owner of Brainpower Nootropics yesterday](http://i.imgur.com/suFrK7f.jpg)

[Here is the Facebook message threat sent around the same time.](http://i.imgur.com/inM7RNW.jpg)

Apparently someone made a bad review of their product on Amazon after their launch post, and he thought it was me. It's obviously not me, but he felt it necessary to threaten me all the same. At first I just decided to ignore it. I thought he would drop it after he vented his frustration with his little idle threat, and that would be it. However, then he decided to step the game up to libel and defamation, by writing a review on our Facebook wall saying that he almost died from one of our products. That took it from an idle threat, to an actual crime. 

[Here is his ""review"" on our page.](http://i.imgur.com/SAubiEg.jpg)

This is obviously unacceptable, and I will be contacting the Leeds police department in the UK to discuss it with them. UK libel and defamation laws are a lot more strict, and him using his real personal Facebook page makes it pretty easy to link. Making fake reviews, of almost dying no less, is not just something that the community cannot tolerate. It is an actual crime. To be clear, we will not accept vendors threatening anyone for expressing their opinions on this forum, nor anyone making threats of any kind. If a vendor threatens you, please contact us moderators, and we will help deal with it.

"Noopept helped save my cat, after he had a stroke.",250,4ez3vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/4ez3vn/noopept_helped_save_my_cat_after_he_had_a_stroke/,76,1460787215.0,"2 weeks ago, my 16 year old cat had a stroke. It was a complication from having an overactive thyroid (t4 was over 160) and a bladder infection. His elevated BP helped push a blood clot into his brain. 

He couldn't walk at all - he'd fall over with each step and be confused what just happened, but he still tried to get to the food bowl and cat litter and use them.

My awesome vet helped with the thyroid, blood pressure and bladder infection but there was not really anything available to help with the stroke recovery.

I remembered that noopept (GVS-111) was originally designed to treat ischaemia / stroke and other brain injuries and I still had a bottle lying around from a couple of years ago. Seemed like it would be worth a shot? My vet was cautious, but open to anything that might make a difference.

I used the allometric scaling calculator to arrive at a 3mg/day dose schedule. With the help of some small syringes (no tip), I suspended noopept in water and gave him daily oral doses. It was important to start as soon as possible.

By day 3, he was staggering like a drunken sailor, but not falling over. At day 6, he was walking in straight lines and had 90% of his motor function back - he just behaved like a typical older cat.

At 2 weeks, he is not just normal again - he is considerably healthier, happier and more active than he has been for 2 years and thanks to the other medication, he has been putting weight back on again.

Animals are surprisingly resilient, but everyone involved has found this to be rather amazing.

I would give anything to figure out why marijuana has this effect, so that I could attempt to imitate it with a substance that doesn't make me high. Anyone have thoughts?

"Creatine, 3.5g/daily for 15 days now, huge reduction in brain fog",244,9e5d8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/9e5d8m/creatine_35gdaily_for_15_days_now_huge_reduction/,203,1536452168.0,"*__UPDATE 1/15/19: I had stopped taking creatine daily because I suspected it increased the number of night awakenings I was having, which compounded by my already questionable sleep quality, was worrisome. However I have resumed creatine in the form of 20 grams per day after very recently sustaining a very mild concussion. So far the creatine is helping with the headaches as well as the general fatigue in the week following the concussion. Studies have backed up its use in mild TBI so I will continue taking this dose until symptoms remit.__*

*__UPDATE 12/20/18: I have continued taking creatine for these past few months until very recently. I often eyeball the dosage with the scoop but it still remains between 2.5 and 5 grams of creatine. It’s effects on brain fog were still pronounced and definitely helped with returning to my baseline. I have STOPPED taking creatine the last few days to test it’s effects on my sleep. I recently resumed regular moderate intensity aerobic exercise to help me recover from my brain fog, and I was starting to suspect that the creatine combined with the effects of the exercise was giving me insomnia. However despite whatever results of this I still hold that creatine reduced my brain fog powerfully which benefitted me in my day to day life as well as at work.
I will note that it no longer gives me a sensation of anxiety or muscle tightness at any dose. And while it has reduced my brain fog, any effects on motivation are gone. It is definitely not a “pushy” feel.__*

*__UPDATE 09/24/18: About 30 days in. I am still dosing daily, and the effects have persisted. This is a dose of about 2.5 grams to sometimes 5 grams now. I have not seen any signs of brain fog creeping back. I am still subject to my quality of sleep, of course. Only CONS I notice are sometimes temporarily heightened anxiety after a dose, and at 5 grams I notice a tension in my neck and shoulders that lasts about an hour. I am still taking creatine monohydrate, though a bulk powder version of it. I am still making sure to hydrate appropriately. I also have continued to take it in the morning, before food. The only other thing I am taking is a lutein and zeaxanthin supplement I started 3 days ago.__*    


For a few years now I’ve had a persistent case of brain fog. It gets worse when I sleep fully, I.e 8 hours. If I’m feeling sleep deprived, the fog itself is somewhat abated but I have all the cognitive deficiencies that come with less sleep.    


My brain fog is a muddling of poor short term memory, slow reaction time, a very powerful unwillingness to engage in any kit of cognitively demanding task, and just the urge to do nothing and go back to sleep.    

Caffeine, nicotine, semax, phenylpiracetam, piracetam, theanine, prl-8-53, testosterone replacement therapy, exercise, magnesium, probiotics, sleeping with no light/sound, and a bunch of other things have not helped it at all.    

I started taking creatine on a whim after hearing it might help with maintaining proper cognition after sleep deprivation. Unexpectedly, I have felt a very significant reduction in my brain fog. I can feel it cutting through the fog, I am able to think more holistically instead of barely being able to focus on one small thing at a time. My memory has returned. And so has my motivation.    

This is a dose of 3.5 grams daily for the last 15 days. I have seen no build up of tolerance.    

I am submitting this to provide another data point as well as to see if anyone has had any similar experiences. I will update if I stop taking creatine or if the effects change.    

EDIT1: The brand is a GNC brand. Monohydrate. Nothing special.

Comprehensive List of GABAA Receptor Anxiolytics That Potentially Produce no Tolerance or Dependence.,238,awt118,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/awt118/comprehensive_list_of_gabaa_receptor_anxiolytics/,115,1551639615.0,"This is a significantly improved and updated version of original post (in comments):  https://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/7jp3vw/alcosynth_drdavid_nutts_synthetic_alcohol/dr8a3m4/

## Introduction (feel free to skip) :

Some here may know me for my in-depth research regarding the topic of GABA based anxiolytics. I have researched regarding GABAergics that does not cause tolerance and down-regulation of GABAA receptors, and I have papers in this field on PubMed. My drive for learning this topic and sharing is due to some personal reasons.

## Common misconceptions regarding GABA A Receptor

Most GABAA positive allosteric modulators(PAM or PAMs), are actually agonists at the benzodiazepine site. Benzodiazepine site itself is a modulatory site of the GABAA receptor's chloride ion channel. Diazepam, for example, commonly known as valium, act as an agonist at the benzodiazepine site, which in return, ups the efficacy of chloride ion uptake. Ashwagandha, skullcap, and most herbal anxiolytics are believed to perform as a benzodiazepine partial agonist.


Direct agonist of GABAA receptors are rare, and they usually induce tolerance and dependence faster than benzodiazepines.
So does benzodiazepine agonist or partial agonists = GABAA PAM, yes you can understand it that way. However another misconception is that benzodiazepine antogonists such as flumazenil are stimulatory. No. An antagonist of a modulatory site means that the modulatory site loses its ability at modulating the modulated receptor.

Another misconception, **arent all benzodiazepines or GABAergics addictive? No,** It depends on the GABAA subunit binding profile of the specific benzodiazepine agonist interact with. Kava and many specific benzodiazepines have shown promise at being anxiolytics without impairing cognition / building tolerance.

Subunits:

- a1 Subunit. Recent research have shown that GABAA a1 to be the most addictive and tolerance building subunit. It leads the tolerance effect as a1 was found to be the subunit where agonists produce most of the downstream changes to your benzodiazepine receptors. a1 is also being the cognitive impairing, sedating, and memory worsening subunit. This means that drugs that avoid this receptor produces no sedating, memory impairing, tolerance, withdrawal, and abuse potential.

- a2 and a3 Subunits. a2 a3 selective agonists have shown to have significantly reduced abuse potential, with their main effects at reducing anxiety and promoting muscle relaxation. 

- a5 subunit is involved in memory, agonist has shown memory impairments while inverse agonists have shown memory enhancement.

This beautiful profile of GABAA a1, a2, a3, and a5 subunit brings a new era of pharmacology where anxiolytics with almost no abuse potential and tolerance is possible. A grand table of what effects GABAA a1, a2, a3, a5 subunits are responsible for in terms of their neuropharmacological profile, [please see table 1 in this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5973310/pdf/ndt-14-1351.pdf)

*Just to be scientifically accurate, even subunits can be further categorized, such as: a1b2g2, a1b3g2 and a1b2g3, etc. However for the sake of this piece being understandable as well as lack of research in these further sub-categories, we will not talk about it more. Is it possible that 1 of these specific a1 subunits contribute more specific effects than another and therefore we can have 2 drug that are both a1 subunit agonist that produce different rate of sedation, tolerance building, etc.*


## Complete List (Pharmaceuticals):

- [Imidazenil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil), One of the most promising benzodiazepines in animal studies that have no human studies yet. It is a GABAA a2,a3 Partial agonist, weak to none a1,a4,a5 activities. Zero tolerance building in [monkeys](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11224341) and [rat](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8013567) studies when chronically high dosed. Pharmacologically speaking, effects should be moderately to strong, in terms of anxiolytic, anti-convulsant effects. Mild to no hypnotic and anti-epileptic effects, and also, mild to none amnesia effects.

- [MRK-409, aka MK-0343 in past literature](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20147571), Another promising benzodiazepine. Partial agonist a2,a3, weak a1,a4,a5. Phase I halted due to unexpected sedating effects, it was not very sedating, just more than desired. Since it was designed as a sedation-free anxiolytic. Dosage in human studies was used between 0.1mg-3.0mg, optimum dose seems to around 1.0mg, 2.0mg starts to produce sedation. Tolerance should be none to very slow building.

- [L-838,417](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-838,417), Structurally related to MRK-409 and TPA-023, it has almost the same pharmacological profile as MRK-409 but have no human studies. It is a a2,a3,a5 partial agonist, even weaker on a1, and almost none on a4,a6. Effects should be same as MRK-409, maybe slightly more sedating due to partial agonism at a5. Tolerance building should be very slow if any.

- [Bretazenil, or Ro16-6028 in past literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretazenil), A promising, (Very low to low tolerance building)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8162672] benzodiazepine. Reached Phase III but halted due to sedation. Extremely promising, Extremely safe profile since it reached Phase III and was halted with sedation as only primary side effect - It was designed to be a sedation free anxiolytic. [Partial agonist a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7905829) [Doses as low as 0.25-0.5mg of bretazenil has shown to improve insomnia and reduce sleep disturbance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7746029)[Bretazenil Synergize with alcohol very well, better than diazepam, infact so well that one should actually not trying mixing them.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8799523) Effects of this drug should be Moderate in sedation, strong in anxiolytic, and moderate in anticonvulsive and epileptic effects. 
Ee
- [Abecarnil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abecarnil), handful of [promising human studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1681563) - very slow tolerance building and only mild withdrawal was noted after chronic use (tolerance was only noted in high dosed groups). Extremely promising, large amounts of human data, [In humans, seems to cause little sedation, moderate to strong anxiolytic effects. Doses in studies ranged from 5mg to above 30mg.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8097921). Looks promising.

- FG-8205 (AKA, L-663,581): almost exact profile as bretazenil, however less researched. 

- [TPA023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPA-023), Dont try this one, Phase I and II showed cataract building up in several participant, extremely promising profile, but unfortunate side effects means this drug has no human potential.

- [TPA023B, Structurally very similar to MRK-409 and L-838,417. a2,a3 partial agonism](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881109354928). Extremely similar profile and dosing as well as effects.

- [TPA123](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cns-spectrums/article/contributions-of-gabaa-receptor-subtype-selectivity-to-abuse-liability-and-dependence-potential-of-pharmacological-treatments-for-anxiety-and-sleep-disorders/A2EEBCA675D1950F806C8F9DBEE3AA18), Tolerance building but slower than traditional benzodiazepines due to [partial agonism of a1,a2,a3,a5.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19789360). Animal studies but lacking human studies. Should be a moderate sedative and strong anxiolytic. 

- [TPA003, Somewhere between agonist and partial agonist on a3](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-0346-0226-6_1), no action on a1 and very weak a5. Should be a strong anxiolytic and very weak hypnotic. I actually wrote a paper debating GABAA a3 to be strongly involved in anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines, as most studies concluded that a2 was the ""sole"" contribution to anxiolytic effects. My understanding is that in a2 studies, mice ""seemed"" to be have less anxiety because they're seem calm, but they're only calm because a2 is also the strongest subunit target for myorelexation. TPA003 is definitely one of the most interesting compounds I have personally came across.

- [EVT-201](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EVT-201),  has successful Trials, more ongoing. Low tolerance building, moderate to strong hypnotic, moderate to weak anxiolytic. Partial agonist at alpha1. Seems to be like a slightly better and less adictive version of current Z-Drugs. [See more on my past post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/6hy5jv/evt201_partial_agonist_of_benzodiazepine/)

- [PWZ-029](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6gg0eh/pwz029_mixed_agonistinverse_agonist_binding/), unique one, partial agonist a3, weak a1,a2, inverse agonist a5. PWZ-029 Improved memory and reduce anxiety at the same time in animal models. Human dosage unknown.

- [Ocinaplon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocinaplon), Care on this one, people with sensitive and liver problems should not try this as the entire Phase III was halted by a single participant whos liver enzyme spiked after this drug. [strongest action at a3, with interesting metabolites that are also similar in profile](https://bmcpharma.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2210-8-11). Otherwise seems extremely promising with good profile. Strong anxiolytic activites and weak hypnotic. [Human studies dosed 90mg 3 times a day, total 270mg/day, with good results, no side effects reported](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-5949.2009.00109.x/full)


- [PF-06372865](https://journals.lww.com/pain/Abstract/2018/09000/A_randomised,_placebo_controlled_clinical_trial.11.aspx). Another a2/a3 PAM. This one is being developed by Pfizer Inc.

- [AZD7325, Another a2/a3 PAM](https://openinnovation.astrazeneca.com/azd7325.html). Binding affinity is high at GABAAα1, α2 and α3 (Ki of 0.5, 0.3 and 1.3nM, respectively), but not GABAAα5 (230nM). AZD7325 is being studied in humans, its been administered orally to healthy volunteers at single doses of up to 100mg and repeated doses up to 50mg QD for 7 days. Adverse events were CNS in nature, and included dizziness, feeling of relaxation, euphoric mood, somnolence, and headache.  *""Two Ph2a General Anxiety Disorder studies have been conducted. In the first, AZD7325 was dosed at either 2 or 5mg BID or 10mg QD for 28 days achieving compound plasma exposures of ~4 x Ki. In the second, it was dosed at either 5 or 15mg BID for 28 days and compared with lorazepam. While the primary objective of greater efficacy vs. placebo and/or lorazepam, as assessed by the Hamilton Anxiety scale, were not met at any of the doses tested, the placebo response rate was considered to be high and reduction in other anxiety endpoints at 10mg and depression MADRS score were noted.""* 

- [Emapunil (aka AC-5216, or XBD-173)](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/325/5939/490), Emapunil is a ligands of the translocator protein [18 kilodaltons (kD)]. It may promote the synthesis of endogenous neurosteroids, which exerts fast-acting anxiolytic agent, both in animals and humans, which lacks the unwanted side effects of benzodiazepines. [Repeated administration shows lack of tolerance and dependence.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584609001699?via%3Dihub)

- [SB-205,384](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB-205,384). SB-205,384 seems to binds preferentially to α3, α5, and α6 subunit containing subtypes, animal models showed that it produces anxiolytic effects with minimal sedation.

- [RWJ-51204](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RWJ-51204). Unclear GABAA binding profile, but sedative effects only come after 20x the dose required for anxiolytic effects.

## Complete List (Herbals):

- [Baicalin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18723037). Baicalin is a herbal compound found in [Skullcap or Scutellaria-Baicalensis](https://examine.com/supplements/scutellaria-baicalensis/) and Scutellaria lateriflora. Baicalin showed significant preference for alpha2- and alpha3-containing subtypes compared to alpha1- and alpha5-containing subtypes in whole-cell patch clamp studies. Its effects should be mildly anxiolytic without sedating or memory-impairing effects.

- [Wogonin](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.07.011). Wogonin's GABAA profile is unclear, but mild sedative efffects were noted on top of anxiolytic and anti-convulsant effects.

- [K36](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.bcp.2003.08.016). K36 is interesting because it is the most potent plant-derived benzodiazepine agonist to date. It is reported to be an agonist at the a3 subunit, however, it also showed some effect at a1 although less potent. In animal models, results are promising as K36 showed anxiolytic effects without motor-impairment / sedative effects. Potentially hinting that its a1 efficacy is rather weak.

- [Valerenic Acid](https://sci-hub.tw/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028390808001950). Not completely profiled, but shows a2 preferance over a3 and a5, and low to none efficacy at a1. Anxiolytic effects were noted in animal studies with no indication for sedation induced by valerenic acid.

- [Apigenin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15451406). Mild partial agonsit at a1, no complete profile. Low potency. Seems to be similar to green tea catechins in terms of effect.

- [Catechins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17175819). Green tea catechins have extremely low bioavailability, and have shown to be a second-order PAM, which means it is a PAM of PAM, theoretically hinting that co-administration of green tea and xanax may enhance the effects of xanax.

- [Triethylene glycol, as found in Ashwaghanda](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172508). Unclear GABAA profile, is reported to be sedative, pass.

- [Withaferin-A from Ashwaghanda](https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajb/article/view/96503). GABAA binding profile unclear. Shows anxiolytic efficacy without tolerance in rats following subchronic administration.

- Miltirone, https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/0304-3940(91)90802-z, a partial agonsit of benzodiazepine receptors. No GABAA binding profile. Miltirone showed promising anxiolytic effects and was neither sedative nor addictive in mice even after chronic repeated administration. Miltirone also showed lower tolerance just as expected.

- [Kava's bioactive compounds](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157700), several kava compounds seem to have unique properties at the GABAA receptor. [Chronic heavy users of Kava appear to be perfectly fine in terms of dependence and cognitive function.](https://www.nature.com/articles/1300052) Caution, Kava contain amounts of liver toxins that vary by strain, this has caused unlucky users to suffer liver failure. 

- [Magnolol from Magnolia officinalis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3221106/) have shown to have efficacy to be an anti-convulsant in animal models just like diazepam, at 40 times the diazepam's dosage. GABAA binding profile unknown. [It is also an anxiolytic in animal models.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11186252)

- [Euphorbia hirta's bioactive compounds](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1007/s00702-007-0821-6), confirmed to contain bioactive compounds that produces relaxing effects through GABAA benzodiazepine receptors. However, sedative effects were also noted.

Insight on caffeine and how it works.,241,af689k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/af689k/insight_on_caffeine_and_how_it_works/,78,1547317798.0,"I stumbled on something at [examine.com](https://examine.com) which is a small thing, but I found it quite interesting. Caffeine works by blocking adenosine receptors (adenosine builds up when we are awake and makes us tired in the evening), which I'm sure many are aware of, but what I found interesting was the distinction between A1- and A2A-receptors and the fact that it is only A2A receptors that get desensitized (which explain quite a lot).

>*Caffeine can block different adenosine receptors in the brain, with varying effects. By blocking the A1 receptor, which promotes sleepiness when activated, caffeine can increase alertness.\[44\]\[45\] By blocking the A2A receptor, caffeine can increase dopamine levels, with stimulating and mood-enhancing effects.\[46\]*  
>  
>*The A1 receptor doesn’t seem to get desensitized, which may be why caffeine doesn’t lose its awakening effect. The A2A receptor does get desensitized, however, which is why coffee veterans don’t feel true stimulation even after drinking several cups — and why some people choose to cycle caffeine.* 

It is a pretty small thing, but still I found it quite insightful. ",2019-01-12 23:59:58

This is a place to advance our knowledge of all nootropics, not simply beat the latest popular one to death. I understand that many of you have questions about modafinil. However, I assure you that they have all been answered before. The search function works well, please use it before asking basic questions that we have all seen 100 times. I do not want to discourage discussions. However, we should limit those discussions to trying to expand information, not regurgitate what we already know.

* Modafinil is a wakefulness promoting agent.

* Modafinil will not replace dopaminiergic stimulants for ADHD.

* Modafinil will not work for everyone.

* Both enantiomers in racemic modafinil are active.

* R-modafinil is 3 times more active.

* Generics seem to be hit or miss. Some think they are the exact same, other don't...

* Your order will take a while to get here. Don't ask us if this is a normal thing.

* Modafinil increases hypothalamic histamine. This can lead to flush-like symptoms.

* There is a 99.999999% chance that you do not have Steven Johnson's Syndrome. If you did, Reddit is not the place to figure that out.

* No, the DEA will not throw you in jail for ordering modafinil. There is a chance that DHS will confiscate your order. If you are in Canada, then there is a higher risk of it being confiscated.

* It is not a miracle drug for improving cognition. There is no such thing. I'm sorry Limitless has misled you.

So if you find any new information on modafinil that is interesting, by all means post it here so we can discuss it. Please, no more long winded anecdotes about how modafinil worked for you.

But the results have been so stunning I couldn't wait.

I came to Semax after [reading this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/b603zg/what_semax_did_for_me/?st=jvi65pk9&sh=9b146327) 

I'm 16 months clean from hard drugs and six months clean and sober. I've meditated, exercised, eaten well, worked the steps, volunteered, gotten into therapy... done everything you're supposed to do in recovery. But Semax is the only thing that's worked for me for anxiety, low mood, and anhedonia. Here is my log:

------------------
SEMAX LOG
Day 0:
I score 12 points on the depression self assessment and 11 points on the anxiety self assessment.
I am often tired, depressed and anxious. On weekends I sleep 14-18 hours a day. I have lots of trouble enjoying things I used to enjoy before I entered recovery (art, music, movies, writing, volunteering).
I have issues with crowds and worrying and am definitely ANHEDONIC. It’s been over 15 months without drugs at this point.

Day 1:
Last night I took 1,000 mcg of semax when I got home. 500mcg or 3ml drop of 1% solution in each nostril. 
I was surprised to feel effects almost immediately, with the “fog” leaving me and a focus settling in.
I wouldn’t call that a high but a general feeling of calm, control and wellbeing.
I usually have tons of issues sleeping but I went to bed at 10 last night and woke up at 750. No issues. I feel rested. Still in a good mood.
Think this is a good sign.

Day 2:
Yesterday was such a good day. I think I felt joy for the first time in recovery while I was alone. 
I was at the supermarket eating some chicken, spinach and quinoa and there just-so-happened to be a full brass band playing. During their final song the tubas made a series of melancholy major and minor chords that almost made me tear up.
Definitely made me joyful.
Also – I did so much stuff yesterday:

•	Put away my suitcase

•	Put away my clean clothes

•	Brushed/flossed/mouthwashed twice

•	Emailed two personal trainers

•	Gymed

•	Went grocery shopping

•	Worked on my freelance job and my day job

•	Volunteered at the animal shelter

•	Changed the air filter on the air conditioner

•	Ate 3 healthy meals

•	Tried meditating (for 2 minutes but still)

•	Did this log
I took another 1000mcg today. We’ll see how work is with semax.

Day 3:
I ended up taking 1500 mcg of semax yesterday. It was good, not as good as Sunday but what work day is.
I’m starting to think that semax doesn’t guarantee joy but unlocks the possibility of it
For sure Mondays at my work are stressful and I’m usually spiraling by 2pm.
That did not happen yesterday, I felt some concern, sure but nothing I couldn’t handle.
After work yesterday I booked a personal training session and also walked dogs and went to a recovery meeting.
Here’s to another day.

Day 4:
Yesterday was another good day, very productive day at work. Wrote a training module for new hires that was complicated. Nailed it on the first go.
Took ~2000mcg of semax yesterday (I think).
Met up with a friend for jazz and saw the personal trainer and then cooked myself a nice healthy meal.
No feelings of anhedonia or depression on anxiety like I was feeling.
Negatives: semax at this dose definitely causes headaches late in the day.

Day 5:
It’s the end of my work day and I handled another busy day OK.
Not bursting with joy and good feelings like I was last time but still handling things very well.
Probably just low sleep last night because I went to the movies.
There is definitely a new depth to things there wasn’t before.
I’m able to solve problems with ease and communicate better.
I can interact with other without being wracked by anxiety.
I listen to music and am able to appreciate it creatively and emotionally instead of just mechanically.
I feel like I’m returning to my old self.

Day 6:
I retook the depression and anxiety questionnaire today.
I got a 2 depression score and a 2 anxiety score.
I’m a bit flabbergasted. I know this isn’t the most scientific way to measure the efficacy of semax but holy shit.
I feel like I have a new grit and a new resilience that is allowing me to tackle the days issue without having a breakdown.
And a new perspective that allows me to be able to experience joy, real joy, even if every day isn’t joyful.
Things are good 😊",2019-05-11 03:53:27

LSD in my Coffee - My 2 Month Miccrodosing Review,235,7dlp2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/7dlp2t/lsd_in_my_coffee_my_2_month_miccrodosing_review/,89,1510961417.0,"Hey friends! Like so many of you here, I was intrigued by the many possible benefits of microdosing LSD. Having taken normal (100-200 mcg) doses in the past and fortuitously having access to some quality LSD, I decided to give it a shot. I kept a journal throughout these two months, with entries for the majority of the days I dosed.

**edit** - No, I was not putting tabs of LSD in my coffee, I was using them sublingually 

*Background* - 28 year old male, pretty extensive experience with nootropics of all sorts, neurotrophics, adaptogens, etc. I'd used mushrooms and LSD on and off for a period of two or three years, from about 19-22, and have only used full doses once or twice since then. Plenty of years of meditation under my belt, as well as regular exercise, yoga, very healthy diet with plenty of greens, yada yada. I say all this just to explain that I have experience with mind-altering substances, am well aware of the placebo effect and that I am fairly fine-tuned with understanding how a multitude of factors may be affecting my subjective experience of the world. 

**Dosing protocol** - My plan was to pretty much stick to the dosing protocol outlined by **James Fadiman**, namely of taking 8-12 mcgs once every 3 days. Sometimes it was one dose every 4 or 5 days, and once I dosed twice within three days, but I otherwise stuck to his protocol. That said, I did *not* dose volumetrically, and would like to do so in the future - because of this, each dose I took was not exact, and I know a few of the doses were closer to 20 or 25 micrograms, just because of how I was cutting the tabs. This was fine by me, as I wanted to see what kind of results these higher doses would bring.

I'll start with the cons.


**Cons**

*Decrease in raw computing power and focus* - Contrary to what many others find, I found that my raw mental power and focus actually *dropped slightly*, by around maybe 5-10 percent, more if the dose was higher. I'd say that my baseline in these two areas is pretty good, nothing phenomenal, but I have no problem sitting down to read or write for anywhere from 45 minutes to two hours before needing a break, and am able to handle a very busy shift at work bartending with little to no errors. My thoughts are almost never erratic, and definitely don't suffer from any ADHD. 

The slight drop in focus and computing power was certainly not off-putting in any way, and in fact I found it mostly beneficial. It felt like I could make associations more quickly, and was more able to think *laterally* rather *linearly*. I would say microdosing increased my creativity and associative thinking. I was able to concentrate if needed, but if I needed absolute attention and raw computing power, I'd rather not have microdosed that day. I work as a bartender and the weekends certainly get intense. I'd always make sure that I wouldn't microdose on days that I knew I'd have a hectic shift.

*Decrease in working memory* - As alluded to above, if I needed to remember 4 different cocktails for one table, ring up a to go order, fire an entree for seat 12 because their appetizer just landed and then try to describe the subtle differences between our flagship IPA and our new lupulin powder based IPA, a microdose would likely throw me off a bit. I found that microdosing decreased my performance and memory in intense situations by maybe 5-10% - I just wouldn't be firing on all pistons. 

*No desire to lift* - Self-explanatory. I'd have to force myself to go lift in the gym, whereas normally I have to force myself to take days off every now and then. Trail running, on the other hand... 

*Higher doses* - Higher doses increased the effects of all the cons listed above. At higher doses (ballpark 20 mcgs), I fumbled my words sometimes, had difficulty remembering something specific, and really didn't have any interest in doing anything productive. That said, things were still quite enjoyable, and I delighted in going for a run in the mountains, a walk in the park, playing with my dog, socializing, listening to music... But I didn't want to be productive or work.


**Neutral**

*Decrease in sex drive* - No surprise here for me, LSD has always made me disinterested in sex. No ED or anything, just could take it or leave it.

*Gas in my teeth* - Not sure why, but the body load of acid or mushrooms has always made me feel like there was some sort of chemical gas in my teeth especially, and sometimes bones and muscles. It's weird, not necessarily bad, and with microdosing was present to a much lesser degree, maybe 50% of the time.

*Little in terms of 2nd day afterglow* - Many people have reported that you microdose one day, have an afterglow or even enhanced effects on the 2nd day, and return to baseline to reset homeostasis on the third. Maybe half of the time I noticed an afterglow on the second day, namely a slightly better mood above baseline, but not really anything ""cognitive enhancement"" wise. May have just been placebo effect since I heard Dr. Fadiman explain it. Not sure, and thats ok.


**Pros**

*Enhanced creativity* - While dosing may have slightly hampered raw computing mental power, it *definitely* increased creativity and associative thinking. Many an insight was made while microdosing, and I was able to see connections between seemingly unrelated things. In this sense, microdosing would fit the bill of a cognitive enhancer, and I could see it having its place in my tool cabinet for all the reading, writing and research I do.

*More synchronicity* - Many of you who have used psychedelics at full doses have probably had more than a few instances of intense synchronicities, coincidences, deja vu, and intuitiveness. Psychedelics are often considered spiritual in nature so this should be of no surprise. While dosing, there were plenty of times when I would think of something I hadn't thought of in a while, be it a topic, object or person, only to have them pop up that same day or the following. Whether you call that intuitiveness or something else, it was noticeable maybe 70% of the times I dosed.

*Enhanced enjoyment* - Man, I just *really* enjoyed my days microdosing. It was all the little things one would expect - music didn't sound different, but it was more enjoyable; driving all these local backroads in the fall, while looking the same as if I wasn't microdosing, was much more enjoyable; I appreciated all the little things more. I wasn't high or felt any kind of pleasant buzz, but I appreciated things a lot more.

*Positive selfishness* - There's probably a term for this, but on days I dosed, I was much more likely to just do what I *wanted* to do, whether or not it was what I *should* be doing. I also found it very easy to say no to things I didn't want to do or to things that others might try to force on me, and all of this in a guilt-free way. And I don't mean I just said yes to eating pizza and drinking beer - more than once while microdosing I drove around the local backroads finishing podcasts I found interesting, or I knew I should be going to the gym, but decided to take my dog for a walk in the park because that was the more enjoyable and meaningful thing to do. If some friends asked me to meet up for a few drinks, I was perfectly happy to say no and continue reading or go through with hiking like I had planned.

*Enjoyment of social interactions* - I'm a pretty social person anyway, and really enjoy interacting with people, be they friends, customers at work or random people on the street or at a bar. This enjoyment was *greatly* enhanced on days I dosed. I found myself interacting more often with random people I didn't know, with no hesitation. I was more likely to make jokes and play around with customers rather than just trying to offer good service. **This was maybe my favorite aspect of dosing**, as well as the following effect.

*More playful* - I'm already a pretty playful person, cracking jokes, playing little pranks, role playing with friends and coworkers. On days I dosed, this was enhanced greatly, and this was the aspect I enjoyed the most. I love people, and the combination of enjoying social interactions and being even more playful *alone* would be enough reason to keep microdosing a regular thing in my life.




**TL;DR** In short, microdosing, for me, *scatters* my mental energies ever so slightly. It slightly decreases my ability to focus in on something, but is great for enhancing sociability, creativity, enjoyment of the majority of activities, especially interacting with others, and is definitely something I would like to continue to experiment with in the future. I'd love to try it with psilocybin mushrooms or psilocybin itself, but alas, these are currently unavailable to me. ",2017-11-18 05:00:17

2 years experiments with nootropics. I finally found best for myself.

Also I had a bad MRI (there were myelin lesions in the left frontal lobe). Doctors couldn't explain the reason. Medicine is terrible in Russia. Have sent to the psychiatrist who has begun paxil - from it or him only became worse in a month. Because the problem was more serious.

For testing, I prepared two boxes, in which I put nootropics. Most of the nootropics I tested before getting to know this subreddit - I got from doctors on prescription (I visited many different doctors) 

1) Nootropics that helped

2) Nootropics that do not fit (no effect or too strong side effects)


Before sending the substance to the box number 2, I tested it several times

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 box (Nootropics that helped):

Bromantane (my top https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6imfwc/bromantane_is_the_best_drug/)

Phenibut (instant socialization, anxiety reduce, better motivation, energy, vision and focus, powerfull antidepressive effect. I would take it forever, but it has a very fast tolerance. You can take 2 times a week. Otherwise there will be a strong withdrawal and drowsiness)

Uridine (very nice https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6fkq42/finally_i_got_to_uridine/)

Piracetam (basic nootropic for memory, mood, energy, vision. The effect isn't very strong, but you can take it forever. Other substances strengthen piracetam)

Alcar (energy, better vision, strengthens piracetam)

ALA (for alcar)

Meldonium (for energy)

sunflower lecithine (safe choline source, for piracetam)

Omega3 (small effect against depression)

Vitamine d (small effect against drowsiness)

Vitamine b6/b12 

Potassium (for alcar)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 box (Nootropics that do not fit (no effect or too strong side effects)):

Methylcolabomin/Methylfolate (super drowsiness and weakness. It sounds like nocebo, but I tried it several times. https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6nh2p9/b12folate_deficiency_symptoms/dka8icb/)

Semax (brainfog and problem with concentration. At first he even helped me, but after the addition of piracetam, horror began. https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/661x9q/semax_piracetam_brainfog/)

Microdosing (hard to think https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/69l6la/first_day_mictodosing/)

Noopept (robot with bad short-term memory https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6o2hvi/noopept_amazing_productivity/dke2e87/)

Caffeine/L-theanine (drowsiness. After a few days, it causes drowsiness. Probably because of l-theine. I read similar stories)

Nicotine (https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6nzu6m/i_cant_use_nicotine_why/)

Intranasal insulin (brainfog, drowsiness, dizzy. I tried from 10iu to 40iu)

L-tyrosine, Nalt (good result in first day, drowsiness in others. Like all the nootropics from this list - I've tried it several times. Each time such an effect)

Ginkgo (stomach pain)

Coluracetam (super depression with suicidal thoughts. A terrible thing. I don't know why, but tried several times sublingually)

Oxyracetam, alpha-gpc (depression. Alpha-gpc in many causes cholina depression, I'm no exception. Oxiratsetam acts on me like a coluracetam, but weaker.)

Emoxypine (mexifican/mexidol) (drowsiness, for 3 weeks except drowsiness nothing happened)

Aniracetam (choking. I took a few steps and started a shortage of air. After that, I checked my heart. It's all right. None of nootropics anymore caused this problem. Even the perception of the world has changed. It's hard to describe)

Huperzine (strong dizziness. It was scary)

Rhodiola (dizziness, very strange condition. The effect is unpleasant)

Picamilon (a little stimulation and relaxation for a couple of hours. Fast tolerance)

Actovegin (tried in tablets. Very expensive drug and weak effect. The positive effect is definitely there, but it is not worth the money)

Phenylpiracetam (it always causes me a very strong migraine. Choline doesn't help. No other substance causes such headaches.)

This bill will literally create a  blanket ban access for the government and AG jeff sessions to ban all  compounds instantly, instead of the DEA having to individually take a  specific substance and prove with an 8 factor analysis that it is a  threat to the american people. Very similar to what happened in the UK a  few years back with the psychoactive substance act. The SITSA bill  would not only ban all research chems but Nootropics as well such as  kratom phenibut modafinil and tianeptine among many others. According to  an email I received a few days ago by the American Kratom Association,  the FDA lobbied a powerful figure within this meeting to ensure it  passes onto the House Floor. If it goes through there then it is all in  Jeff Sessions hands at that point. 

I just learned about this yesterday  from the kratom subreddit where an individual stated this information  from the House Rules Committee meeting where they addressed the SITSA   bill,  ""For those who were watching the House Rules Committee Hearing  this   afternoon, it was expected that Representative Pocan would  present his   kratom amendment before the Committee.  Unfortunately, the  combination   of the delay in the start of the Rules Committee Hearing,  and another   legislative issue that required the presence of  Representative Pocan in   another Hearing and a House Floor issue that  prevented him from getting   back to the Rules Committee before the  SITSA portion of the  Hearing  was closed.  Representative Pocan did  file the kratom amendment  in a  timely way, and the Rules Committee  should vote on the amendment  before  SITSA is referred to the Floor.   If the Rules Committee defeats  the  kratom amendment, we will then look  to amend SITSA on the House  Floor.   The House is expected to vote on  SITSA on Friday""

Top 5 Nootropics that have helped me the most.,230,8fajc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8fajc2/top_5_nootropics_that_have_helped_me_the_most/,148,1524852714.0,"There are top 5 nootropics that have helped me the most.

**BRIEF HISTORY**

* 22 year old college student. High-stress environment, but I never *feel* stress acutely like most people, though I do feel it chronically as ""burnout"" (threshold: 10h+ days for 4 weeks+ with no breaks in-between).
* ONE Thing that makes it or breaks it: **Sleep from 8-10pm, Wake at 4:30am**
* What ALWAYS helps: Meditate, Exercise, and Diet regularly (one cheat day a week). *[next step: add cardiovascular work with C25K]*
* Extremely sensitive to changes in these routines (especially sleep schedule). Without them, would occasionally have moodswings with depressed mood (but nothing clinically diagnosed). It gets VERY BAD, but as long as most of the aforementioned things are in place they NEVER happen. I'm confident that as long as my sleep is REGULAR, the whole world could be in flames and somehow I still wouldn't be able to feel depressed.
* Default personality: Type A and always building up momentum, getting things done and moving things forward. These things make me feel alive. Conversely, when things are moving purposelessly slow, I become bored (immediate), restless/anxious (short-term) and depressed (long-term).
* Highly-sensitive to external stimulus. Noise isolation headphones and earplugs work really well for me because they essentially conserve all the energy that would've otherwise been dissipated to these trivial stimuli.
* No history of insomnia. No history of psychiatric or medical conditions (previously had pre-hypertension).

Nootropic | Effect on me
---|---
Fish Oil | Classic staple for cardiovascular health. 
CoQ10 | Classic staple for cardiovascular and hypertension
Bacopa | Improved memory in the first year. Can tell loss of effect if I'm off for 1month+
L-Tyrosine | Gamechanger for me. Able to focus on only ONE thing at a time. This plus earplugs gets me in the zone without fail (most effective fasted)
Ashwagandha | Always works to relieve stress. My mind feels lighter. **Too much and I feel like I'm just drifting through life though**. But if coupled with L-Tyrosine can be very effective. (Not effective with Rhodiola, Caffeine/L-Theanine, must be used in isolation and does not improve my sleep).

Other nootropics that I take as needed:

Nootropic | Effect on me
---|---
Rhodiola | No significant effect. Taking it regularly now to finish the bottle. Seems to keep moodswings at bay. (Thinking of removing it, what do you guys think?)
Phenibut | Think of it as a stronger Ashwaganda, or as a supplement with only the positive effects of Alcohol.
Caffeine/L-Theanine | AVOIDING IT. With all the nootropics available to get me into a calm focused state and generate high-quality work, it makes no sense to me to go back to caffeine. One cup would get me energized, but that energy is dissipated and not channeled. Two cups would again get me in the zone when I am ready to kill a fucking lion. Three cups and I won't be able to sleep. It's great for anything physical (pre-workout for a gym PR), but terrible for any intellectual where higher cognitive functions are required (learning). **Coffee is like a shotgun whereas L-Tyrosine is like a sniper rifle.** Replaced with green tea instead.
Magnesium | No noticeable effect. Seems to keep moodswings at bay. Still taking it because there's no harm. (Thinking of removing it, what do you guys think?)

What are the top 5 nootropics you swear by? What nootropics should I remove from my stack?

"Hey /r/nootropics, I need your help/input with an experiment I am running, it's like a coffee brew that mimics the effects of an LSD microdose (in me at least, and I'm curious about others)",228,2xonnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/2xonnt/hey_rnootropics_i_need_your_helpinput_with_an/,158,1425344705.0,"I posted this in /r/Psychonaut and someone suggested I post it here.

Hey /r/nootropics, I need your help/input.

I'm autistic and I've used psys (mainly LSD) to fix my life. I went from on-the-brink-of-homeless to working/studying in the field of neuroscience and therapy.. I still regularly experiment on myself with various drugs and I still need psys to keep my life in order.

The biggest problem I have is that psys give me insights, but the associated emotions and feelings don't last. So, when I'm off them, I STILL have to fight against my consciousness all day to function normally, but my insights into my own psyche and the human psyche make it easier.

Microdoses are pretty much a cure for autism for me. If I'm on a microdose of LSD or mescaline, I have perfect days, utterly perfect. Psychedelic tolerance is a big issue and my ""golden egg"" in life is trying to circumvent it.

I have found a bit of a roundabout way to do it, and I'd like your input, and if anyone is willing to try it I'd be very grateful for some feedback.

Basically, I've mixed a couple of seeds/plants into a type of coffee that mimics the feeling of a microdose, for me anyway. The ingredients are:

* 1/4 teaspoon of powderized guarana (I just chuck the nuts in a blender, but there's more efficient ways to do it)
* 1/8 teaspoon of powderized nutmeg (this has to be fresh from the nuts, processed nutmeg won't do the trick)
* 1 teaspoon of raw cacao
* 1 teaspoon of any coffee powder, I use mocca

The active chemicals in this mix are 

* **caffeine** (*guarana* and *coffee*)
* **theobromine** (*guarana* and *raw cacao*)
* **MAOI** (tetrahydro-β-carboline, *raw cacao*)
* **elimicin** (precursor to mescaline, *nutmeg*)
* **myristicin** (precursor to MMDA, *nutmeg*)

All of these combine to give an experience that lasts roughly 6-8 hours. This experience feels almost identical to an LSD microdose (around 10-15mcgs). Elevated energy, colour enhancement, creativity enhancement, massive amounts of energy, positive and magical feeling to the day. I have used it consistently for a while now and it has been EXTREMELY effective. I doubt it's a placebo but I can't be sure, which is why I'm posting here. I can't discuss any of this stuff with my colleagues or in my faculty for obvious reasons.

If anyone has some input or is willing to try out this brew for themselves that would be awesome.

(Please note that raw cacao is not the same as cocoa. Cocoa is heated and processed cacao, and in a lot of cases it has sugars added to it as well. Raw cacao is just the bean, which actually tastes quite bitter and is a bit chunky)

(**UPDATE** Four experience reports so far. One person with autism who had a nearly identical experience, one person who had a productive day, colour enhancement and increased focus, but needed to redose on coffee, and one person with anxiety, colour enhancement, and one person with no effects.

**FURTHER UPDATE** It would seem that this brew is DEFINITELY active, except it varies from person to person, but it's not always the intended results. In the majority of cases, similar effects are experienced, but not all of them. Only in the case of one other user, who has autism like me, were the effects identical. I can rule out a placebo in that case since I didn't tell him what it would do, and his description was pretty much identical to mine. In about 10-15% of the users, no effects were experienced. Take from this what you will!)",2015-03-03 06:35:05

IT WILL NOT LAST FOREVER.  This is extremely important to know when experimenting with nootropics because some can put you in a bad mood, dangerous state, or even suicidal.

If you take something and it makes you anxious, just stay calm, do some deep breathing and/or other calming activities, maybe have some calming foods, and wait it out.  You can always go to the bathroom if you are in a social, academic, or work setting.

Always remember the phrase, ""this too shall pass,"" just like anything in life.  Don't attach to any one thought or mood and think you will be that way forever.  Just let the nootropic wear off and realize you will be back to normal soon.  **Bottom line:** be AWARE of yourself and DETACHED when you try nootropics.

I'm an 18 year old guy, one of my nr 1 'life rules' has been to be healthy, both in diet and physically (since I was 12 year old). My diet has been extremely clean for the past few years and I do calisthenics (bodyweight workouts) on daily basis.

Although my diet was great and I always looked strong and healthy.. I had some serious issues with my mental health (cognitive function) pretty much ever since I entered the puberty. 

I didn't had any traumatic experience when I was young or negative thoughts that led me to depression.. 

This brainfog was a mix of uncontrolled depression and anxiety that was always present in my life (started when I was 14).. but every year, I would get a 'season' of extreme depression and extreme anxiety which often led me to stay in bed for weeks or even months.

This seasonal crap didn't happened just in winter or just in summer (it wasn't a seasonal depression), it happened at ANY time and could last throughout the whole summer till winter or even longer. 

After a while.. I seriously started to worry. I have a girlfriend and we plan to have a future together and I just COULDN'T feel this way anymore..

My symptoms were: anxiety, chronic fatigue, depression, mood swing, sensitivity to pain/light/loud sounds, no libido.. one word: HELL

I would never end my life.. but after experiencing this.. I understood why some people do 

It felt as if my body or brain couldn't handle life anymore.. while I am truly one of the luckiest people alive.. I have a great/supportive family, an amazing girlfriend (soon wife), great plans for the future, ALWAYS been full of joy and optimism..

But I was literally dying inside. 

I decided that this is it, I won't give up on life without fighting for it.. 

I visited waaaay too many doctors.. who took blood tests (for everything) that always came back perfect. They said that I 'stress too much about my brainfog.. which just makes it even worse'.. they recommended me to practice some meditation and yoga (great tip)... that's exactly what I wanted and needed to hear at the darkest times of my life. 

I took things into my own hands, didn't gave a sht about doctors and started to look into /nootropics on reddit, herbs and natural supplements 

I started to see some light on the end of the dark tunnel that I've been in for sooo long. I started to read people's experiences EVERY day (it became my new hobby) and I ordered some suplements. 

I bought:
- Magnesium (mineral) 
- Black seed oil (seed oil) 
- Ashwagandha (herb/root powder) 
- Rhodiola Rosea (herb/root powder) 

This is how I'm feeling after about JUST 2 weeks of supplementing:

- energy improved, I sleep MUCH less and feel amazing 
- no more depression 
- no more brainfog/memory/focus issues 
- anxiety.. GONE 
- great mood throughout the whole day 
- my social life improved DRASTICALLY.. due to my new mental clarity, better memory and focus
- I'm stable, feeling grounded and confident af
- my libido is through the roof (probably due to the ashwagandha).. me and my girl have had so much fun lately 

I went from a zombie to a freaking superman!!!! 

I'm not PROMOTING ANYTHING 

It's UNBELIEVABLE how I feel now.. maybe it was just a magnesium deficiency or maybe the black seed oil known for 'cure for everything except death' healed something that my doctors couldn't diagnose.. 

Anyways.. this stuff is amazing and everyone who's struggling with mental health for no known reasons, should REALLY consider trying these amazing supplements 

I just want to thank YOU all the people here on this community and I would be sooo happy if someone else could fix things they struggle with on daily basis like I did..

My daily doses:
- Magnesium: 1250mg a day
- Black seed oil: 3g in the morning and 3g in the evening 
- Ashwagandha (root powder): 4,5g in the morning 
- Rhodiola Rosea (root powder): 500/1000mg a day 

If You have any questions.. feel open to ask about anything and good luck on Your journey to a better, healthier and happier life.

Edit:
I see many people mention here bipolar disorder, mania etc.. You need to understand that I'm not feeling like I'm high on some drugs, I'm feeling like I'm back to my NORMALSELF. This is how every other 18 year old should feel like.. mental clarity and feeling energetic. It's like being an 80 year old grandpa (I literally felt like that) and going back to youth where u had energy to be outside all day long.. 

Thank u for all the support tho!!",2019-05-22 05:37:18

I guess caffeine blocks serotonin & gaba in the short-term so you have less available... but then there's a long-term overcompensation effect so that on days where you don't drink coffee you have more GABA & Serotonin available?

Can somebody explain how to look at this?

I can only speculate that on the days where I stop caffeine I go into an overly parasympathetic but not very comfortable state (more gaba and serotonin release?) where I'm not particularly interested in doing anything at all (might be withdrawal tough)... my sleep is better too.

""Are there any nootropics to help me get to sleep at night?""

""Are there any nootropics to help heal tendon injuries?""

""Are there any nootropics to make my girlfriend do anal?""


I may have made that last one up, but you get the point. The definition of ""nootropic"" is already kind of vague -- a drug that improves cognitive function -- but it seems that we are taking any specificity that's left out of the definition. ""Nootropic"" is being used to mean ""a drug that does what I want but lets me call it something else other than a drug."" I don't know if it's because people want to feel superior in some way, or they don't like to admit that they're using drugs, or what the reasoning is, but it seems like the word ""nootropic"" is quickly becoming totally meaningless here... there are more and more instances of the term ""nootropic"" being used simply as a synonym for ""drug"".


If you want a ""nootropic"" to reduce your appetite, you want an appetite suppressant or a stimulant, not a nootropic. Are some stimulants also nootropics? Sure. But not all.
If you want a ""nootropic"" to help you get to sleep at night, you want a tranquilizer/depressant, or some other drug that promotes sleep, not a nootropic.

Yes, drugs can be useful for these purposes... but unless these purpose involve *cognitive enhancement*, you aren't talking about nootropics, you're just talking about drugs.

That includes Melatonin. I tried standard  dosages OTC (3-10mg) and even megadoses (over 40mg.) I finally have committed to the low-dose specified in studies, and have slept much better 3 nights in a row. It has to be under 0.4mg and I may even be noticing that it’s even more effective below 0.3mg.

Basically after reading and researching turns out fish roe is by far and away the best source of DHA for multiple reasons. First because roe has the highest % of DHA of any food by far. 

Secondly because the DHA in roe is in phospholipid form which allows it to be transported directly to the brain. the DHA in most capsules is not in this form.

Comparing DHA concentration in all egg yolks (not including H-DHA egg yolk), the highest DHA concentrations were found in duck egg yolk (1.8% of total fatty acid) and quail egg yolk (1.5% of total fatty acid), respectively.

>A form of DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid, with its own transporter.
Salmon roe is rich in the omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA. Not all DHA forms are created equal, however. The DHA in salmon roe is in phospholipid form, which may play a unique role in human physiology. It turns out that humans and some animals have a transporter, called Mfsd2a, in their brains. This transporter targets the phospholipid form of DHA and moves it into the brain. Research has shown that animals that have been genetically modified to lack Mfsd2a transporters have 60% less DHA in their brains compared to normal animals. Other research shows that humans who have a mutation in the gene that encodes for the Mfsd2a transporter develop early neurodegeneration.

Scam alert: NewMind/LiftMode stole $470 from me.,212,bolu9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/bolu9u/scam_alert_newmindliftmode_stole_470_from_me/,111,1557883507.0,"I still cannot believe it, but NewMind/LiftMode has scammed me. I share my story here with the community so that you are fully aware of their despicable business activities before making any purchase with them.

I live in the UK and am a regular shopper in the US. To save on shipping costs I frequently make use of a US-based parcel forwarding service, which allows me to consolidate multiple packages from different vendors and save tremendously on shipping cost.

On April 5, I decided to buy for the first time some products from NewMind for a total amount of $473.40. I paid with Bitcoin and everything went smooth. Next day the package was sent to the US forwarding company. When they received my package they said that they are reluctant to send it to the UK because of the PSA. Admittedly, some of the items such as cyclazodone are on the risky side and I understood their concern. I asked NewMind for a return label and proposed them to instead send everything directly to the UK and apologized for the inconvenience (I proposed to pay for the return label). They immediately provided the return label and said that they would contact me from the moment they received the return package and proposed to give me a full refund. A full refund was not what I had initially mind, but I didn't mind at all since I could then switch the cyclazodone with something else.

Everything good so far, but it went downhill from here.

April 19: I still haven't heard anything from them (a domestic return package should only take 2 days to arrive). So I asked them if they received it.

April 23: Still no response from them, so I asked them again. They answered that evening and asked for all details about the Bitcoin transaction and my wallet address so they can refund me, which I gave.

May 7: No further communication from them and no Bitcoins sent to my wallet. I gave them a friendly reminder.

May 10: Again nothing. I sent them another mail and warn them that if they don't respond within 4 days, I will take further actions and the first step would be a Reddit post. At that time I just wanted my money back and didn't care about re-buying any of their products anymore (if I ever would got my money back).

&#x200B;

Here we are today, still no response or refund. They knew I was going to post the full story on Reddit and still they didn't bother to reply. Apparently, to them, $473.40 is worth much more than their reputation.

Oh and to make matters worse, the price of Bitcoin went up massively, so I lost a lot more than that $473.40 by now...

I've been dosing 200mg Modafinil for 12 months - My Personal Experience.,208,898l35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/898l35/ive_been_dosing_200mg_modafinil_for_12_months_my/,129,1522753651.0,"Hi there folks, I've been a reader here for quite a while but i haven't engaged a whole lot, however i feel as if i'm at a point where i can share an experience of mine with the use of Nootropics. This is going to be a relatively long post, however I will leave a Dot-point summary at the base.

I began using Modafinil (Modalert) close to 12 months ago, after hearing about it on a Podcast, and ignorantly and easily persuaded me decided to order some to try it out for myself. I'm going to start this with a brief experience overview followed by some Positives Vs. Negatives i have experienced.

**My overall experiences**

I take Modafinil two days per week, back to back at a 200mg dosage per day, generally at around 12pm (midday), often with or just after eaten lunch.

My initial experience for the first 4-6 doses was incredible, I 'felt' a difference, I could consciously feel myself paying far greater attention to my work (i was running a E-Commerce business at the time in addition to a Full-time job) and having little-to-no brain fog at all, which for me was an absolute godsend, as I am generally a pretty anxious/easily distracted person.

Skipping forward about 6 months, whilst still taking the same doses, at the same times, those feelings no longer come. If i think about it on a day to day basis, I am marginally more alert than without it, however if feels although the effects are no longer as strong as they once were - this could come down to my tolerance level, but I would have assumed taking it only twice a week, that I wouldn't build a tolerance... please let me know if I am wrong.

At this present moment in time, I continue to cycle Modafinil, at the same levels as before, on the same days. The story has not changed since 6 months ago.

------------------------------------

However, one thing I HAVE noticed, is that when I dose modafinil whilst working at my day-time job, on the days i dont regularly dose, the effects are greatly felt. I work in Sales, and the benefits are crazy. I am FAR quicker on my feet in terms of responses to questions from customers, i can bring product knowledge to my tongue lightning fast, I become more witty, I never get distracted and overall i just feel like i'm 'pingin''... the Benefits go on! I guess, I feel as though I become a well-greased wheel in my Sales role when using Modafinil - and my sales figures often represent higher conversions, higher ticket price sales, all the while being faster and obviously more effective. 

i've tested this theory many times in the last twelve months. It's important for me to mention that I have also ruled out a Placebo effect by blindfolding myself, and allowing housemates to give me either one dose of Modafinil or a common vitamin.

To cut the long story short, I feel as though the effects in my experience of using Modafinil have worn off greatly, again, this may be due to a tolerance build up, and I may have to step up my dosage to feel full effects. I feel although the drug is marketed in the wrong way - a lot of first time users assume they will have crazy super human abilities as depicted in movies - this for me is far from the truth. However general memory recall is raised marginally.

Summing up, for those who didn't want to read my poorly written essay:

**Positives** - 

- Marginally increased Memory Recall.
- When the dosage is right, and no tolerance is built up, I experienced laser like focus on my business work.
- Brain Fog decreases tremendously.
- Not a bad pre-workout (I say this half joking), I have felt an increased focus on lifting weights, better technique, and less overall awareness of being tired/less-energy, compared to normal workouts without dosing.
- Ability to talk faster
- Less time needed to think of answers on my feet
- Ability to recognise distractions and cut them out earlier than normal.

**Negatives** - 

- Problems sleeping from time-to-time.
- Brain fog the day after a dose upon waking
- I personally feel that in order to feel effects you cannot just take it and do a normal day - you need mental stimuli and to be working on a project that requires great attention to detail - this is when i notice the full effects.
- Urine smells like Acid.
- Headaches upon taking initial doses, also when not drinking enough water.

Thanks for allowing me to share, and if not for anything else i would love to hear your own personal takeaways from using Modafinil, and if anyone has information on Tolerance build up regarding my dosage, please let me know. I'm all ears.",2018-04-03 16:37:31

I've been working on my life for a while, I was a very socially awkward introvert who would get nervous just going to a store to buy gum. I started working out and eating less and ended up losing around 80lbs and gaining some self-confidence along with a positive body image, but my anxious habits and fear of change stuck around.

I did some reading about Ashawagandha, and decided to try taking that along with the Vitamin D, fish oil, and biotin I was taking before this. I felt like my anxiety definitely lowered a bit, so I bit the bullet and tried Phenibut.

Phenibut made me myself. I could freely feel and empathize with people without worrying about what they think of me or what's going to happen to me next, but here's the thing - this feeling has changed me even when I'm not taking Phenibut.

I seldom take Phenibut anymore, but I feel that the experience showed me what consciousness is like when you're flowing freely with life and not constantly worrying about the next time or how you're seen. I've learned in my experiences in lowered anxiety how people don't really care that much about you, they're focused on themselves. This was the takeaway that I needed.

It's a stretch to call this a cold shower and you are probably missing out on most of the benefits and just making yourself uncomfortable. This isn't about ego, it's about getting the therapeutic dose if you're going to put yourself through the discomfort of cold water in the first place. 

According to [Rhonda's paper](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/news/s/d5oth5/new_20-page_report_on_cryotherapy_just_released_cold_shock_boosts_norepinephrine_up_to_5-fold_increase_type_of_immune_cell_that_kills_tumor_cells) on this a lot of the good stuff happens around a 2 degree drop in body temperature and if you look at the hour long soaks at cold temperature it took to get there it's obvious a little 30-90 second exposure isn't going to do anything.

>It appears that a 2°F reduction in core body temperature is e nough to induce cold shock proteins, including RBM3, in human astrocytes (a type of brain cell). By way of example, in one study, young men that stayed submerged in cold water of 68°F (20°C) for one hour were able to l ower their rectal temperature to around 96.9°F (36.1°C) or if they stayed in 57.2oF (14oC) water for 1 hour they were able to lower their temperature to 96.1°F (35.6°C).

I did a big writeup here tracking my biometrics [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5ohi9a/home_heat_stress_training_and_cold_shower/) mostly on sauna but I have a section on cold shower. About 10-15 minutes of straight cold in 57F shower water I was able to get to 97.1F core temp.

I have shitty tolerance for cold water but the miserableness goes away if you just stick it out for a couple minutes. I intended to 'ease in' my first time but after 30 seconds I just said fuck it and kept going and then got warm after a minute and went to a full 15 minutes. When you go hot cold you're just subjecting yourself to the worst part over and over and getting much less benefit. 

Unless you have one of those crazy showers that hits you from all angles or doing cold water immersion you're only getting focused cold application in one spot while the other 80% of you is in lukewarm purgatory so you need time for it to drop your body temperature.

Cold showers are such a powerful thing for your health, more powerful than any sleep supplement, nootropic, or fat burning supplement I've tried, and it's a shame to see most people simply not doing it right. Once you get to two minutes it's just as easy to go to 15. 

>But my water is reeeeeally cold

First, actually measure that shit because without a thermometer most people who haven't done much with cold water think their water is literally a just-shy-of-ice 35F when it's actually 70F (talking from experience). If you're in a standalone home in Minnesota then you have an excuse, or you are really lucky. If you live in a city, high rise, etc this is especially important as your water is probably a lot warmer. Second, cryotherapy chambers go to -264F and a session is 3 minutes, 2:30 for noobs. You should at the very least be able to make it to 6-10+ minutes in a steamy 60F shower.

Since this is /r/nootropics and you want a pill for everything, I've read that Tyrosine increases cold tolerance so this could take the edge off, but I haven't tried it. However, if you're doing this at night it might also keep you up and mess up the amazing sleep inducing benefit of cold showers.

Also, as I mentioned in my [previous writeup](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5ohi9a/home_heat_stress_training_and_cold_shower/), the addition of a sauna followed by cold shower is a magnificent combination and makes the initial part much easier. 

It didn't do much for me but apparently Wim Hof breathing helps with pain tolerance. 

If your shower is much above 65F I honestly don't know if I would bother, I haven't found any research finding biochemical changes above that. I think above 65F the only cold shower benefits you are retaining are mental fortitude and nice skin/hair, which is still nice. You'd be better off just going outside for your cold exposure, though. In the summer I would look into ice baths or check out the Cool Fat Burner ice vest. 

There is an option if you do want super fast cold exposure and that is cold water immersion in very very cold water.

>There have been studies comparing the norepinephrine response to cold­water immersion (whole body submerged for 20 seconds in 40°F) with whole body cryotherapy (2 min at ­166°F) and found they are more or less identical, at least in that respect.

That is a lot of work, however, to set up for a 20 second dip and at that point you also might as well stay in for a full soak because

>Now, if you were to stay submerged in that cold water for an hour as opposed to just 20 seconds we know that norepinephrine would increase 5­fold. Which brings us back to the point that exposing the body to cold for prolonged periods may have a more robust effect.

One final trick you can do is drink a big glass of ice water before starting the shower. This will help increase the rate of cooling. 

tl;dr Stop pussyfooting around with the shower knob and just leave it on cold the whole time, it's less miserable than cycling and you might as well get the full benefits if you're going to make yourself miserable in the first place. 

PS. Body fat decrease after 6 weeks of sauna/cold shower
Since I linked to my previous [sauna+cold shower writeup](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5ohi9a/home_heat_stress_training_and_cold_shower/) I figure I'd put an update in this post. I've continued my sauna+cold shower combo. I've averaged a bit more than every other day. I started this regimen after a couple months in a wheelchair and I was thoroughly deconditioned and my bodyfat had risen to 19-20% (using an omron handheld monitor). In about 6 weeks my last few readings have been 9.5-13%. I know these things aren't super accurate which you can see in the wide range but clearly this has shifted way beyond the error range. To put this into perspective I could never get it below 14% after months of workout out in prior years. This huge drop is despite not being in ketosis (though I am fairly low carb) and not being able to do 'big lifts' like deadlifts/squats (I've had to focus on upper body). So while I have optimized a lot of things I think clearly this heat/cold exposure training is having a massive effect. It feels like it is amplifying the exercise effects by a factor of two or more with less injury and a trivial amount of additional work.",2017-02-16 01:25:45

The Ultimate Guide to Enhancing Your GABA System (Reduce Anxiety),209,62w5lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/62w5lk/the_ultimate_guide_to_enhancing_your_gaba_system/,79,1491116043.0,"This is a complete guide that covers all of the best natural products that up-regulate and enhance GABAergic activity. I'm pretty sure nothing significant has been left out, but I will update it if something is pointed out to me that should have been included. Hopefully this will help a lot of you out and can be used as an effective guide to enhancing the system GABAergic. Enjoy!

So.

GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in humans. It reduces neuron excitation in most areas of the central nervous system, and blocks impulses between nerve cells in the brain. Low levels of GABA can be associated with anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) and epilepsy.

**The Function of GABAergic Medications**
 
Drugs that enhance the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid, such as *benzodiazepines* (benzos) like *diazepam* (Valium), at the GABA-A receptor result in sedative, anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) and hypnotic (sleep-inducing) cognitive effects. As well as being useful in treating anxiety and insomnia, GABAergic drugs are also used to treat seizures, muscle spasms and alcohol withdrawal.
 
However, these drugs should only be taken for serious medical conditions, since they carry with them the risk of addiction. Furthermore, those wishing to improve their GABA system gradually over time, rather than treating it in the short-term, should also consider the dietary factors involved in the GABA system, and the natural methods we can use to enhance the GABAergic system.

**How Do We Produce GABA?**
 
GABA is synthesised in the brain from the amino acid glutamate using the enzyme *glutamate decarboxylase* (GAD), with *pyridoxine phosphate* (Vitamin B6) as a cofactor. Glutamate is synthesised from the essential amino acid *L-glutamine* using the enzyme *glutaminase*. [Image here](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/39c32c_c65a4a8a88a6409eab5bc88157db1d5b~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_788,h_150,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/39c32c_c65a4a8a88a6409eab5bc88157db1d5b~mv2.png)

Treating anxiety sounds pretty simple then. Increase your intake of L-glutamine and you will have more resources to produce GABA, and increase your intake of pyridoxine and you will be able to convert more of the L-glutamine into GABA. 

Unfortunately, it's not that simple. 
 
The reason it's not that simple is that GABA can actually be converted back into glutamate in a process called the GABA shunt, and glutamate is also a neurotransmitter, but which has exactly the opposite effects of GABA.

**The Glutamate Paradox**
 
Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in our nervous system. It is an important neurotransmitter for memory and learning because of the role it plays in neuroplasticity, but in excessive quantities it can lead to excitation problems such as anxiety disorders. 
 
The GABA shunt pathway usually keeps glutamate in check, but there are number of things that can aggravate this pathway. Lack of vitamin B6 is the most significant factor for insufficient conversion to GABA, but auto-immune dysfunctions can also inhibit the GAD enzyme, which catalyses this conversion. Food intolerances such as gluten intolerance, along with hormone replacement therapy, are notably responsible for this inhibition of GABA conversion. 
 
**GABA Transaminase Inhibition**
 
GABA begins its conversion back to glutamate through the action of the enzyme GABA transaminase. If this enzyme is inhibited, however, then GABA levels will remain at higher levels.
 
> *Lemon Balm* (or *Melissa officianalis*) and *Rosemary* (or *Rosmarinus officianalis*) contain the compound *rosmarinic acid*, which has been shown ([link to study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19165747)) to be a GABA transaminase inhibitor. This compound can reduce the rate at which GABA is shunted back to glutamate.
 
**GABA Receptor Agonism**
 
A method of increasing GABAergic effects, especially in the short-term, is by using GABA analogues that agonise GABA receptors.
 
A receptor agonist is a chemical that binds to a given receptor, activating it to produce a biological response. The nootropic drugs phenibut and picamilon are the best known agonists of both GABA-A and GABA-B receptors, but there are also number of natural products that have proven effectiveness as GABA agonists.

> *Passion Flower* contains the flavonoid *chrysin*, which has been shown ([link to study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17966676)) to be a GABA-A receptor agonist.
 
> The amino acid *taurine* has also been shown ([link to study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18171928)) to be a weak agonist at GABA-A receptors.
 
**GABA-A Receptor Allosteric Modulation**

There are also a number of natural products available that act as GABA-A receptor positive allosteric modulators (PAMs).

These modulators create an amplification in the effects of an agonist, increasing the activity of GABA-A receptors, and creating sedative and anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects.

> *Valerian* contains two compounds—*valeric acid* and *valerenic acid*—that have been shown ([link to study](http://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2004&issue=02000&article=00016&type=Fulltext)) to be PAMs.
 
> *Kava* contains a class of compounds called *kavalactones* that have also been shown ([link to study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12383029)) to be PAMs.
 
> *Ashwagandha* (or *Withania somnifera*) contains several steroidal lactones called *withanolides*, particularly *withaferin A*, which have also been shown ([link to study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20044800)) to be PAMs.
 
The class of drugs known as *benzodiazepines* (such as *diazepam*, or *Valium*), as well as alcohol, are also positive allosteric modulators of GABA-A receptors.
 
**GABA Reuptake Inhibitor**
 
Reuptake inhibitors inhibit the reabsorption of a neurotransmitter from the synapse back into the neuron after it has performed it's activity.
 
> *St John's wort* (or *Hypericum perforatum*) contains two compounds—*hyperforin* and *adhyperforin*—that have been shown ([link to study](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/026988110101500109)) to induce noncompetitive reuptake of various monoamine neurotransmitters including dopamine, serotonin and GABA.

**L-Theanine**

One final consideration is *L-theanine*. *Theanine* is a highly effective nootropic that has a wide range of applications. It is commonly used in combination with caffeine due to it's synergistic effects, and its ability to reduce the negative effects of caffeine. It is commonly found in green and white tea.

It is a weak glutamate antagonist (it blocks the effects of glutamate) but this effect is too low to be wholly responsible for its calming effects. It has been shown ([link to study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17182482)) to increase levels of GABA, dopamine *and* serotonin.
 
**Summary**
 
In summary, there are various methods involved in our ability to naturally enhance GABA function. Many of these methods work synergistically together to produce a greater effect than any one its own. Reuptake inhibitors work synergistically with receptor modulators, and precursors work synergistically with metabolic inhibitors. Combining several or even all of the compounds discussed, at lower doses, is surely a more effective method at enhancing the GABA system in both short and long terms.

Black Seed Oil Has Repaired My Broken GABA System - Rebound Depression from Benzos No Longer an Issue,209,70kcqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/70kcqv/black_seed_oil_has_repaired_my_broken_gaba_system/,75,1505635553.0,"**Background:  I've always reacted abnormally badly to alcohol, benzos, barbiturates & Z-drugs like Ambien.  Next-day depression was HORRIBLE.  Like, suicidal depression and awful raging irritability after a single dose of a benzo or my migraine meds (Fioricet).  I'd put it on par with the MDMA-induced depression I've experienced.  Just sheer misery.  I already have depression, OCD & anxiety but depressants worsen all three severely.**  

I originally tried Black Seed Oil because it was said to potentiate kratom, but I found that it put me in a very low mood the first few times I used it, so I backed off.  Now I only take it on weekends--1.5 droppersful in the evening.  Think I started using it in May or June of this year.  

Even with my low/infrequent dosing, something big has changed.  I no longer experience those wild mood swings after taking benzos or Fioricet.  Even high doses.  (Don't get me wrong--I will NEVER get into the habit of abusing downers again.  That's not the point of this post).  I keep waiting & waiting for the other shoe to drop, but this effect is real & lasting.  

I am completely baffled how this oil could have such an effect on my GABA system.  The longer I took BSO, the less noticeable the depressed feeling would be after dosing.  Now I don't feel depressed at all when I take it.  

I've read that people with autism/Asperger's (which I have) [have messed up GABA systems] (https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/12/a-brain-link-to-autism/), so maybe that was responsible for my horrid reactions to depressants.  I don't know, but the difference is night and day.  This supplement is so beneficial for my bizarre mood issues & could probably help certain types of depression too if taken consistently.  

Anyway, just wanted to share my experience.  I'm not a big supplement taker & have never noticed real effects from any nootropic/supplement I've tried (tianeptine excluded).  I've been a daily low-dose user of stimulants & opioids for the past 14 years, which I take along with my Prozac to help make me functional.  That combo works relatively well, but absolutely nothing I tried could offset those benzo-induced rebound symptoms.  

Black Seed Oil has now made it possible to take benzos on the rare occasions when truly I need to, such as when flying or going to the dentist.  And I can take my migraine meds without feeling like shit for the following 2 days.  That's worth so much to me.  I'm still in shock, honestly.  ",2017-09-17 13:35:53
I recovered from drug-induced cognitive damage with nootropics,208,6exryf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6exryf/i_recovered_from_druginduced_cognitive_damage/,169,1496472769.0,"The purpose of this post is twofold: First, to briefly thank this subreddit for all of the incredible knowledge it lent me, and second, to outline my recovery from drug abuse and the nootropics I used to do it.

Some background on the extent of my damage: For about two years I abused just about every abusable drug know to man. I'd enjoyed drug use responsibly for years, and I would like to state that I draw a very distinct line between ""drug use"" and ""drug abuse"" even now. Responsible use requires monitoring and knowledge of drug effects on your cognition and impacted receptors. Abuse takes place when one knowingly goes too far for the sake of some escape or solace, and I'm a firm believer that the root of most (at least, non-prescribed) addiction is depression, and that one is unlikely to treat the symptom that is addiction without also addressing this source. I lost my balance following a traumatic time period that caused me to throw caution to the wind and suppress my misery by any means necessary. Even this began with some degree of responsibility - an alternating schedule of benzos, opiates, and dissociatives that allowed for at least three days between the usage of each class. Also, loads of weed. As most here probably know already, this sort of schedule is inadequate for avoiding addiction and is unlikely to be maintained. I did not maintain it, and carefully-metred drug use gradually declined into wanton polydrug abuse that royally fucked up just about every critical neurotransmitter you could name. What followed was extreme anhedonia, depression, and anxiety, and being quite unsure that I'd ever feel normal again.

From this point, it took me about a month to feel like recovery was well within my grasp, and three months to recover 100%. It's been some time now and I feel confident in saying that nootropics and good habits not only restored me to a healthy state of being, but have boosted my cognitive state well beyond where I was at prior to that whole depressive mess. I won't be providing any tests or measurable evidence because my only metric was ""feeling okay"" again, and I traveled such a gulf of misery to get there that I need no such validation.

I've seen a lot of folks here ""try"" this or that, bit of bacopa here, bit of piracetam there, etc. I've gotta say up front: You have to throw the book at this stuff. If you're fucked up and you know it, what isn't worth recovery? Balanced nutrition, exercise, and a slew of healing chemicals are your best bet for climbing out of a seemingly unscalable pit. All at once. Some of these things might make you feel worse before you feel better, and some things will make you feel better, but either have no long-term benefits or can result in actual harm. All of the following information is subjective; I can only say what worked for me and what I concluded from independent research and the good folks here on Reddit. Without further ado, here is a rundown on what I tried in order of perceived efficacy.

**Recreational drug abstinence:** Maybe it need not be said, but this is step one. If you are coming off of benzos or opiates, TAPER. Cold turkey is not the way to go with these things if you're in deep. Cut anything else right out... Although I will say that ketamine can be immensely helpful in staving off withdrawal symptoms during taper, using an addictive recreational substance to get off of addictive recreational substances is a very dodgy call. The real road to recovery doesn't start until you're free of everything.

**BPC-157:** This stuff is a miracle. I used it for about four weeks and gained sustained benefits. For the first five days or so, the side effects were not positive - fatigue, increased depression, brain fog, several of the things I was trying to heal. Thereafter I found my circadian rhythm restored, and the real benefits began. In fact, ""restored"" isn't even the right word. I've always had trouble sleeping, and suddenly I found myself becoming tired after dark and rising rejuvenated with the sun. Mood stability increased massively and my urges to get high all but disappeared. In addition, the soft tissue healing properties reversed long-standing injuries that prevented vigorous exercise, which leads me to...

**Exercise:** Opiates and weed essentially replace the ""runner's high"", and intense cardio is immensely important when attempting to recover from their absence. It's critical that you get opiate and cannabinoid receptors used to getting their fix from their natural source. A mile a day in the morning will accelerate healing rapidly.

**Black Seed Oil:** A teaspoon of this stuff granted me instant relief from symptoms of GABA downregulation. Again, I would strongly recommend using this WITH other balancing agents such as BPC and bacopa. It's hard to go overboard on recovery when you've gone overboard on destruction.

**Bacopa:** Similar to the above, but with more side effects. Heavily sedating, I continue to take this, but do so in the evenings so that the drowsiness doesn't inhibit my daytime productivity. I'll note that users seem to have extremely varied responses to this stuff. If it doesn't seem to work for you, give it a while. If you have intensely adverse reactions, give it up. There are other options that are more objectively effective.

**Noopept:** Of all the ""stimulating"" nootropics I tried, this came with the most positive cognitive side effects. In fact, I started using this prior to attempting any other solutions, so I have some idea of its efficacy alone, which is significant. Anxiolytic and anhedonia-relieving. Don't overdo it! I've read many reports of responders to this substance turning themselves into non-responders with overuse. I had great results at first with 30 mg/day in the morning, five days a week, with two days off, two months at a time. Nowadays I use just 10mg/day. With responsible use it seems to become more effective over time. Sometimes I like to stagger more (3-4 days on, 3-4 days off) so that there is no perceivable ""crash"" when I take a month off.

**Choline/Uridine/Fish oil stack:** Man, they aren't kidding when they call this stuff the building blocks of neurogenesis. I found this to be a very effective combo SPECIFICALLY when combined, and I credit it with a great deal of lasting benefits. After a couple of months, this stack started to jazz me up a bit too much, so I dropped it, but cognitive benefits remained thereafter.

**Semax/Selank/P21:** I had high hopes for all of these, and all were helpful in their own way, but I can't say I've noticed any long-term benefits from any of them. Then again, I used a whole lot of shit, so it's hard to say. I found these a bit racey when used repetitively, so I eventually prefered to cycle between them over daily use of any individual peptide. They're great for those times off of noopept.

**Magnesium:** Excellent for GABA repair in reasonable doses. Perceivable effects are somewhat subtle compared to everything I've already mentioned, but I've certainly found no drawbacks to daily use.

**B-Complex:** With an emphasis on B12, this stuff is brain juice. I don't have a lot to add. Its benefits are well-documented and prolific. Aim for capsules and sublingual tablets over pressed pills for maximum bioavailability.

**Ashwagandha:** This stuff is great for GABA, but I have doubts as to the wisdom of long-term use. Its calming effect is acute with use and I perceived a minor withdrawal upon discontinuation. No big deal, good for temporary relief either way. I think it may have slowed my overall recovery however. I noticed faster improvements after I dropped it. It's hard to say for sure whether or not these observations are valid. Such is the main drawback to attempting everything at once.

**Lion's Mane and Cordyceps:** These are two highly-reputed brain-boosting fungi. I can't say as I noticed any obvious benefits upon their addition, but I also can't say there weren't any. Who knows? Didn't hurt, that's for sure. It should also be noted that I've had visual snow since childhood (very much not from psychedelic use), and some folks said Lion's Main in particular helped with this. Such was not the case for me, but it could be the case for someone who specifically suffers from HPPD.


Alright! That wraps up the list of beneficial things. I'd like to take a moment now to list a few things I've seen recommended here that I would specifically avoid to people aiming for healing.

**Weed:** Yes, I already mentioned drug abstinence, but this one bears special mention because so many people treat it as benign. For one, it interacts poorly with BPC-157 in my experience. It also has an effect on GABA and will exacerbate withdrawal symptoms from benzos and such. In the case of the latter, it can be quite harmful. And good luck ridding yourself of anhedonia permanently if you have a weed habit. It's a quick fix, but a major drawback in the long run. If you must smoke it, do so well after recovery is achieved.

**Phenibut:** You guys, seriously. This stuff can be just as harmful to GABA receptors as benzos. Don't do it if you're recovering. Not even a little bit. It's not worth it.

**Caffeine/Nicotine:** I'm unsure why these classify as nootropics to some. Habitual use of either is clearly detrimental, and no justification is necessary therein. Dopamine imbalances at the very least are likely to ensue. That said, Semax/Selank both boost the effects of these tremendously, for better or for worse.

**Alcohol:** Modern drug culture may not call this a drug, but it is, and it will specifically inhibit GABA recovery. No bueno, sirs and madams.

**Tianeptine:** No one with a prior opiate addiction should touch this stuff. It may be a mild agonist, but it isn't mild enough. There are safer - if less effective - over the counter antidepressants out there. Opiate receptors take a very long time to recover from abuse, and I'm not sure as yet that I can see opiate usage ever becoming safe for a former addict again. The brain is quick to fall back into old habits in this regard, even with irregular use.


All I can really say in addition to all this is: Eat healthy as fuck. Avoid wheat if you're capable, and at the very least avoid products using enriched flour. Whole foods are your friend (and I don't mean the super expensive regal hippie store). People have varying opinions on fasting, but I've found five-day juice fasts to offer very quick relief from negative symptoms. Couldn't hurt to kick off a recovery regimen with one. At the very least, the calorie deficiency leaves one little energy for anxiety. I'm not going to provide a full nutrition guide here because it's not the place, but do your homework and do your body right. It has the ability to heal itself when given the implements to do so.

Thanks again, everyone. I hope this information is helpful. It should be noted that I've also found positive acute results from L-Theanine and ALCAR, but never used either to an extent that qualifies me to speak on them. They didn't blow my mind or anything. Although, if you are suffering severely troubled sleep (constant waking, nasty nightmares), do give L-Theanine a try in the night. It seems to have a calming effect on the dream state.

Pharmacist Nootropic Input Website/Blog?,211,5quxj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5quxj4/pharmacist_nootropic_input_websiteblog/,65,1485740298.0,"Hey, everyone. US Pharmacist here. 

Been using Nootropics for about 5 years now. Whenever I add a new one, I usually spend a good amount of time researching it. The one thing that has been itching/bothering me, during my research, is the lack of scientific evidence or the massive amount of pseudoscience. I realize I do not have the resources to extensively research these compounds, e.g., a clinical trial, but I feel I may be able to connect the dots for a lot of people. 

I have been playing with the idea of starting a blog/website that I would do some write ups on the compounds/research. I would be open to suggestions on the subject matter of the articles. I have access to a lot of academic databases for articles and also the pharmacist thought process would be a unique addition. Would this be of interest to some of you? Just want to get a feel for things before I invest the massive amount of time. 


**TLDR:** Pharmacist. Love nootropics, hate pseudoscience and hand waving. Should I make a nootropic website with evidenced-based claims?

**Edit**: A lot of interest. 

- I need some people to play devil's advocate. What are the foreseeable problems? Is there a website/podcast that currently does this?
- Someone link me to some good tutorials on website/blog design, please. I am pharmacist, not a web designer :)
-  I have some PhD pharmacology graduate student friends that can maybe write some guest posts with some financial persuasion e.g., I buy them lunch haha.

**Edit2:** Looks like I am going to go through with this depending on my free time. 
My tentative plan:

- This would be different from Examine by being more personalized. I would take input from the public/you guys and gals, and write a personalized article with my pharmacist spin on things. I would have guests articles from different professions/fields (thank you guys/gals for the inbox love). I see Examine more as a database whereas my site would stimulate intellectual conversation on Nootropics. 

- An analogy: imagine you are picking up your prescription. Examine would be the giant packet of information you get with your drug, my site would stand as the quick personalized conversation you have with the pharmacist upon picking up your prescription.  

-  I would like to do a monthly literature review on Nootropics e.g., new ""studies"" or research

- Once this grows, we could find some financing model that would allow for free 3rd party testing of Nootropic suppliers and maybe some sort of stamp of approval(?).

- Always open to suggestions. Stay tuned.

[ » penultimate part ]
● Hello dear NootHeads, I’ve been trying a few Nootropics those last years to find out my ultimate stack, since everyone’s chemistry is different, and I thought that some people in this amazing group would like my personal and subjective view of the ones I tried so far. I always make good amount of research before buying products/compounds and I use only the best brand possible even if it’s more expensive… Priority for my health!

Phenibut: I really liked it. It gave me a huge anxiolytic and calming effect. It took around 3 hours to work and it is very useful when it’s time to speak in front of people, since it relieves all stress and anxiety. My dosage was 500mg for the nootropic purpose.

PRL-8-53: By far the best Nootropics I have taken for short term memory. Combine with Coluracetam to avoid building tolerance is even more powerful. The best combo for stuying. (8mg)

Galantamine: This one I used it only before sleeping. It give some incredible vivid dreams. To maximize the effects, one should take it in the middle of the sleep cycle. (waking up 4 hours after falling asleep) (7mg)

Sulbutiamine: At first, I was disappointed, but I continue to try it out every now and then and I can say that it works great. Nice boost of energy and motivation. (200mg)

Alpha GPC: My principal source of Choline. It really helps me to be clear headed. (600mg)

Pramiracetam: I liked it for the good memory enhancement but I felt like a zombie, no emotion, irritable, frustraded for nothing etc. On that I became an analytical Robot. (250mg)

Ginkgo: This one I tried it once, after a couple of researches I conclude that it wasn’t necessary with the Nootropics that I already had… (30mg)

Lion’s Mane: This one too, I tried it once. Since its and BDNF and NGF and I was already on Noopept. It have great potential but need to do complete cycle. (3000mg)

Aniracetam: I didn’t hate it, nor like it, I didn’t feel an effects or what’s so ever, maybe a more relaxing mood. (Taken for a month) (1300mg)

Coluracetam: My favorite Racetam family! HD vision, mood, choline uptake, memory and an amazing anxiolytic effect. Note that I feel like I can read people more easily on that. (3mg)

Noopept: I really like Noopept, even if I feel a bit robotic mood-like it’s worth the shot (Taken for 1 month on 1 month off) (30mg)

Fish Oil: General health and good to put in a stack.

Super B12 Sublingual: Very effective taken in the morning, it gives a little smooth boost and restart the circadian cycle. (1mg in the morning)

L-theanine/Suntheanine/L-theanine Sublingual:: The best ROA for me was the sublingual solution. Simple way to relieves stress. (100mg)

Super Rhodiola Sublingual: Very effective taken in the morning, it gives a little smooth natural energy boost (20mg)

Tianeptine Sodium: Very effective too for the mood. (12.5mg)

Memantine: Didn’t get the effect I thought. (10mg)

Kava Kava: Subtile, almost non-existent. (300mg)

Picamilion: Same. (300mg)

Sunifiram: Pretty good, but drop it for health concern. (Tumors related) (10mg)

Magnesium L-Threonate: Best form of magnesium. Pretty effective. I take it before bed. A bit expensive though, Glycinate form is close to its effective and is way cheaper. (150mg)

Quercetin: High source of vitamin C, Antioxidant that reduces neurotoxicity. (1,136-2,272mg)

R-Alpha-Lipoic-Acid: Powerful antioxidant (300mg)

5-HTP: Helps restore serotonin levels. (300mg)

ALCAR: A great supplement that I often use. I feel more focus on it, it’s a great supplement. I noticed that when I use ALCAR, it increase in some way the BBB and makes the Nootropics works even better, but it’s just a subjective thought, I need to do more research on the mechanism. (1000mg)

NALT: Good to synergise a stack. Very good for young healthy people. There is scientific evidence for helping creativity. (500mg)
Ubiquinol QH-Absorb: Didn’t feel more energetic on it. It say that it increase the production of mitochondria in the body. (100mg) (http://www.reddit.com/…/fact_check_please_700_words_on_coq…/)

Spirulina: High source of Vitamin. (1-8 g per day)

Echinacea Complex: Good for immune support (400mg)

Ashwagandha KSM-66: My favorite natural Nootropic along with Bacopa. (250mg)

PhenylPiracetam: I loved PhenylP. Nice energy boost and concentration. It keeps me focus without jittery. (100mg)

PhenylPiracetam Hydrazide: tried once. Potentially better than the non-Hydrazide one. (100mg)

Coleus Forskohlii: Nothing (500mg)

Epicor: Very good for immune support, health support. (500mg)

Bacopa (Bacognize): It was part of my night stack. After a complete cycle, I can’t really say that I had a huge cognitive increase, the effects were most likely very subtle. But the calmness that it gives me is very interesting. In the recent researches I made, I learned that I must take it during 3 months to feel the get the effects. (300mg)

NSI-189 : Decided avoid it for the moment. I have no major injuries nor drug abuse damage related. (20mg)

Dihexa: Same thing^ (?)

Modafinil : Very effective. It isn’t technically a Nootropics, but the concentration and focus are very pronounce and I can easily sleep at night with it. (100mg)

IDRA-21 : I did 3 or 4 days consecutive on it and it stopped due to some negative manic side effects. Also I suspect that I am allergic to Ampakines due to the itchy feeling on it. (7mg)

Caffeine/NALT Sublingual: Very handy and useful, also very effective. (430mg)

N-Acetyl-Semax Nasal: Very subtle. I doesn’t ‘’feel’’ it. I am maybe a little more focus and alert, but it can easily be Placebo effect. (2-3 sprays)

N-Acetyl-Selank Nasal: This one is very interesting, it is one of my favorite noots so far, and the anxiolytic effect pair well with the focus. I like it. (2-3 sprays)

Pyritinol: This is one of my favorite Nootropics too, mix with ECGC and ALCAR makes a very good stack! (600mg)

Green Tea (50% polyphenols, 35% catechins, approximately 20% of which is the important EGCG fraction): Good to synergise a stack or to pair with 5-htp. (500mg)

Tianeptine Sulfate form salt: I prefer this salt form. It is, in overall, better than the sodium. No need to redoes 3 times a day with this one. (41.25mg)

Noopept Nasal: This ROA is way more effective than any other administration. This is now the way to go for me with Noopept. (2-3 sprays)

Unifiram : So far, it feels more ‘’cleaner’’ than Sunifiram, awesome mental energy, I get less mentally tired with it and the concentration I get from it is on point. (7mg)

● Those are the ones that I have not tried yet:
-Bromantane : (tried some sample, but I need a complete cycle to see the effects) (50-100mg)
-NASEMAXA Nasal Spray: 
-N-Acetyl Selank Amidate Spray:
-Epitalon and its deriatives: 
-(-)-BPAP Sublingual: 
-P21 Nasal: 
-Theacrine: (Better than Caffeine without building tolerance)
-Orchlorafinil AKA Compound 2. : Modafinil Analogue. 180%-200% more powerful but with a high half life
-Crebinostat: (THT is down.)
-Centrophenoxine:
-Turmeric Curcumin and Piperine:
-Creatine:
My current stack is mainly supplement for winter bad mood: (https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208556124206308&set=gm.10153725825504360&type=3&theater)

Two years of Modafinil use. A positive physiological and psychological addiction.,202,7jz4bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/7jz4bg/two_years_of_modafinil_use_a_positive/,122,1513365858.0,"This is my experience and I am not speaking for anyone else. I have been taking Modafinil (Modalert 200mg) for just over 2 years. Normally twice a week but in recent months about 3-4 times a week. 

The effect on any given day depends on two things: Amount of sleep and my mood. I have realised that almost every time the experience was slightly different. 

How Modafinil affects me: 1) After a day on Modafinil I sleep extremely well. 2) I have extremely clear thoughts the whole day. I can approach difficult issues in a clear and lateral way and find insightful solutions easier. It does not necessarily increase my focus when working. (Writing etc) Its a thinking drug for me. 3) I am alert and aware unlike anything I can put into words. 4) Taking it with L Tyrosine takes motivation to the next level. It is really incredible. And herein lies the problem.

The Problem: I suffer almost no side effects from Modafinil. In fact, I enjoy it so much that I have started increasing the dosages from twice to about 4 times a week. No tolerance issues. There should not be any tolerance issues with a drug like modafinil as it is prescribed for daily use. My physiological and psychological enjoyment have made me realise that I feel sometimes that I need to take it. Herein lies the biggest issue: Dependence. This is a great realisation I had whilst being on Modafinil.

I have now decided to take a break from Modafinil for 6 months. It is a sad goodbye from a good friend. There is so much info about modafinil and its effects. What I love about Reddit is the fact we can share the experience and learn from each other. I for one will always love Moda.",2017-12-16 00:54:18

How many nootropic users are unknowingly self-medicating undiagnosed mental disorders?,205,5endtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5endtl/how_many_nootropic_users_are_unknowingly/,180,1480016670.0,"
Lack of concentration, terrible procrastination, feeling of underachieving and later depressive episodes resulting from it (not the other way around) are the issues I have been struggling with for a long time. Only recently, after getting diagnosis of ADHD and getting medicated for it, my life started improving tremendously.

Anyway, recently I started reading more about nootropics, and I realised that the reasons why people are looking into *smart drugs* are often the reasons why I decided to seek professional help.

I'm wondering for how many people the underlying condition, often undiagnosed, is the push to look for help, and how many people are simply, for one reason or another, trying to work or study in a manner simply unsustainable for a healthy non-superhuman?

"If you havent tried meditation, you should",207,5csemq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5csemq/if_you_havent_tried_meditation_you_should/,69,1479103782.0,"For those of you who dont just want noortropics to improve your cognition but general methods to improve it, you might want to check out meditation. For one, it induces a psychedelic state of mind,  which is fun. Aside from that, it has a slew of benefits that are rather surprising. For example, it stimulates hippocampal neurogenisis which not only improves working memory, but slows the aging process of the brain. As any of you may know, the brain shrinks every year simply because it loses cells, like your body, but never replaces them. Increased neurogenisis, or the release of young neurons can fill some of these gaps, and while not a solution, certainly slows the progression. Additionally, it grows the hippocampus which leads to better emotional regulation, and potentially memory formation. It seems to even improve white matter connections leading to better verbal fluency. 

While many of these things likely arent what they seem, the increased size of multiple brain regions (hippocampus, frontal lobe, other areas I cant remember) certainly is. 

Anyway, its a worthwhile ability to learn, and is rather simple if you find the right technique. This one is great, https://youtu.be/1vx8iUvfyCY

I slipped my grandma with dementia some Alpha GPC in her drink and this is what happened. Judge me!,202,7m5r52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/7m5r52/i_slipped_my_grandma_with_dementia_some_alpha_gpc/,109,1514292066.0,"So I realize what I did is a little controversial but let me explain lol. My grandma is 89 years old and her mind is almost totally gone. She has good days and bad days, and today was a ***bad*** day. We invited all the family over for Christmas dinner and my grandpa told me when they arrived *“Careful, grandma is going into orbit.”* I can tell it’s bad when she starts to repeat her home address over and over again or she forgets that I’m married, and she also curses a lot. She is also *super irritable* during these times, and can be really mean to the family. I was sitting down eating and talking with my aunt and she was really frustrated with my grandma because she had been watching her all day, and she was pretty snappy. I was telling my aunt about Alpha GPC and how it helps with memory, and she jokingly mentioned that I should slip some in her drink. I told her I had some, and we both just sort of laughed and looked at each other. Then she said “No really, it would be really helpful to me. Please go get it. She won’t notice it.” So I put 150 mg of Alpha GPC from Nootropics Depot in her juice, and she couldn’t taste a difference. Drank it all.

Sure enough about 20 minutes later she was calm and collected. I don’t think she’d be able to name off everybody in the room, but she wasn’t obsessing over where she was, or who this person or that person was. Or cursing at family which was nice. 

I found [this study](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00207454.2013.765870) and a few others that confirm Alpha GPC’s benefits for people with dementia. Maybe don’t do what I did though, this was a bit of an “emergency”...

***Update***: She’s gone home now and some of the things I noticed were...

1) ***She wasn’t obsessing over where she was***, like she usually does. She always forgets which state she’s in, and if she’s still living in Rochester, New York or not. She didn’t ask about that while she was here.

2) ***She didn’t recite her address over and over again***. This one was big because it’s really sad when she does this. She’s really afraid of forgetting where she lives.

3) ***She still repeated certain stories and phrases.*** She tends to tell the same 4 or 5 stories over and over, and that didn’t change.

4) ***Still a little cranky.*** She gets tired quick so this might just be a side effect of that.

5) ***Still asks where her husband is a lot.*** He’s still alive and, often in the same room. She worries a lot about losing him, which is why she repeatedly asks about this.

I frequently get this sort of response when I ask for CoAs from vendors and manufacturers, and it reeks of arrogance to me, that they feel they don't have an accountability to the consumer to demonstrate the safety of their products and the trustworthiness of their practices.

Of course, they don't actually have that accountability unless we enforce it, which is why I'm posting this here. I'm hoping that this can start a dialogue about how we can encourage companies to not only engage in good business practice, but be willing to be transparent about it also (within reason of course).

TLR (True Life Research) Product Testing Results,198,2xf8z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/2xf8z7/tlr_true_life_research_product_testing_results/,140,1425119498.0,"As some of you may know, TLR has been selling proprietary compounds and extracts since they launched. That led a lot of people, including myself, to call them out on the practice. Who in their right mind would take something that they did not know the ingredients or chemical structure of?!? We also questioned their testing practices, which led to the owner telling customers that they did not need testing, and that people should just trust them. Again, more red flags. Then we had the owner threatening to sue us moderators for slander, libel, and defamation. There are other crazy things that people have made me aware of via private message. However, we will not get into that at the moment. Needless to say, I have been interested in testing their products for a while, and have been organizing to do just that. Today, we have those results.

Again, a big thanks to Nootropics Depot, for use of their lab in this testing.

Let's start with the most alarming results. Four of TLR's ""proprietary"" compounds have tested as Taurine powder. That's right, TLR has been selling ADJ01, MORP-OX, HDAC-OX, and ADDX-OX as proprietary compounds, yet they are just Taurine powder! They are touting their ADDX-OX as ""Scientifically Engineered Proprietary Optimized Extract Formulation Acting Upon Resetting Addiction Targeted Pathways and Counteracting Hyper-Psychoneurodysfunctional States."" They are selling at-risk people with addiction, Taurine, yet telling them it will help them with with their addictions. This is flat out unacceptable! The ADDX-OX is selling for $140 for 24 capsules. They are selling 50 cents worth of Taurine for $140! I've spoken to one of their customers that is dealing with addiction, and bought that from them thinking it would help. After it doing nothing at all for him, he wrote me wondering if it was BS. Well now we know for sure it is.

Their MORP-OX is listed as ""a first-in-class herbal Mu Opioid Receptor (MOR) Positive Allosteric Modulator (PAM) Optimized Xtract."" It's a first class capsule of bullshit, is what it is. It's just Taurine in a capsule.

Their HDAC-OX is listed as a ""Scientifically Engineered HDAC Class I Inhibitor (HDAC-C1I) Extract."" NOPE, just Chuck Taurine.

Here are the percentages for each of those:

ADDX-OX- 94.79% match to Taurine

ADJ01- 99.16% match to Taurine

MORP-OX- 98.44% match to Taurine

HDAC-OX- 98.47% match to Taurine

____________________

Now we move onto the other results. These are more what I expected, rather than just Taurine capsules. A few of their other ""proprietary"" compounds and extracts came out to be normal things like Maca and Noopept.

Their ADJG2 is a 99.04% match to Noopept. It's not on the site now, but has been sent to a few people.

Their ADJB1 is a 96.58% match to Maca root powder. A customer that got ADJ01 from TLR actually asked the owner if it was just Maca root, since that is what it seemed like. The owner denied it, saying it was a totally different proprietary extract. Riiiight.

The HCBT-OX is likely Shilajit. Shilajit is not in the reference library, though. So we will need to do more testing on it to know for sure. It is an organic compound, somewhat related to Ashwagandha and Holy Basil. However, the physical characteristics match Shilajit. It's like little chunks of tar. I have no idea how we would expect people to use it properly.

There are a few other unreleased compounds that he was selling to customers who asked. ON-1 was an 85% match to ashwgandha, with distinctive peaks in the mid-high wavelengths. OB-1 was a 92.27% match to Niacin. It looks to be a mixture of things, with mostly Niacin in it. The other proprietary things we tested did not match anything in the reference library. So perhaps some of them are real. We will have to do some more testing to know.

Now for some good news. Some of the things they were selling as real compounds, actually were real.

Coluracetam was a 99.11% match to our reference sample.

Fasoracetam was a 98.54% match to our reference sample.

NSI-189 Freebase was a 99.10% match to our reference sample.

Memantine HCL was a 97.45% match to our reference sample.

So it appears that at least some of the non-proprietary compounds are what they are supposed to be. Some of the proprietary ones are things like Noopept, Maca, and Shilajit. Some are not in the reference library. Then some are just Taurine. Keep in mind that we have not tested every one of their products, since they have a metric shitload of them. We tested ones people were complaining about. If anyone else has any suspect TLR stuff, they can send it to me for further testing. We can also pay for further in-depth testing of any compounds that did not show up in our reference library, if people feel that is warranted. On that same token, if someone is willing to gather samples, and send them off to a third party lab, I am willing to pay for further testing. That will eliminate any claims of bias that might be made. I just did this testing round to get an idea of what we were dealing with.

My Observations on Vitamin C After 2 Years of Use,195,bfgtwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/bfgtwk/my_observations_on_vitamin_c_after_2_years_of_use/,158,1555821665.0,"I've been taking Vitamin C for 2 years now and it is undoubtedly my favourite supplement. I take 1000mg of Ascorbic Acid every morning, along with 100mg of bioflavonoids and 25mg of Rosehips. This is a timed release caplet that spreads the dose out over a 6-8 hour period.

Here are my observations. Keep in mind that these are anecdotes and thus subject to the placebo effect. That being said, this experience is stretched over 2 years, with a noted reduction in these effects without use, and an increase with use, consistently.

**Benefits:**

* Improved stress tolerance. I am able to study longer and tackle more projects without becoming overwhelmed. I feel calmer. This is different from my experience with ashwaghanda which makes me feel lazy, tired, and apathetic. Vitamin C seems to simply increase my stress threshold, I assume due to cortisol mediation. 

* Reduced allergies. I have better energy and less hayfever symptoms during the spring and summer. I used to wake up sneezing regularly and now I rarely, if ever, have these symptoms. I attribute this to histamine regulation. 

* Improved mood. This may also be related to the reduction in stress and histamine levels, but I consistently notice a mood boost from Vitamin C. It gives a subtle but noticeable feeling of relaxation. 

* Better energy overall. This could be due to the above mentioned factors, as well as the antioxidant activity/glutathione boosting effect. 

**Side Effects:**

* None that I have observed. There is some literature that suggests a correlation between [Vitamin C and oxalate renal stones.](https://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/15/12/3225.long) However there is some doubt about the methodology of the study, as well as the fact that Ascorbic Acid can [reduce the formation of certain types of stones.](http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v09n05.shtml) It also appears that there is no known risk of increased renal stones from [intravenous Vitamin C.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5981254/)

Something to note as well is that the researchers found no correlation between high Ascorbic Acid intake from food and oxalate stones. This suggests to me that theoretically, taking Ascorbic Acid with high doses of cofactors as well as a meal containing fibre could mitigate this risk. 

Overall, Vitamin C is cheap, beneficial, and consistent. If you have any issues relating to histamine I would suggest trying a good quality brand of Ascorbic Acid with cofactors.",2019-04-21 10:11:05

IDRA-21 and weed is literally a living hell - BEWARE!,191,711vrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/711vrm/idra21_and_weed_is_literally_a_living_hell_beware/,69,1505843016.0,"Hello everyone. This is my first post here, sorry for my bad english, not my mother tongue. I am generally a lurker here and don't post anything, but I thought I needed to write something after what happened to me last night, I hope to help out and eventually even save someone else from this terrible mistake. I am still in shock. Keep in mind this experience happened around 12 hours ago.

Some time ago I ordered 500mg IDRA-21, but still hadn't tried it. Yesterday I decide to finally do it, after receiving my new precision scale. 

I weigh out exactly 5 milligrams of IDRA-21 and take it at around 2:45 P.M., after lunch. I feel absolutely nothing for a few hours, then I started noticing the effects. 

I was more focused, everything was *sharper*. I really don't known how to explain the effect properly, let's just say that I tend to perceive the world as more *dynamic* when sober, kinda hard to focus, my mind wanders around a lot, I often get distracted and drawn in my own thoughts. With IDRA, everything was more *static*, I perceived the surroundings as if they were under my control, as if everything was under my control. It was a real nice feeling overall, with just 5 mg! So went off to work and had an amazing session, no distractions, just got stuff done.

Time passed, I had dinner at approx. 8:30 P.M., then back to my house. I could still feel the IDRA, the half-life is around 48 hours from the reports available online, so that was normal. 

Then I had the fucked up idea: smoke a joint. I thought about possible interactions with the IDRA, so I researched online, but found **nothing** (main reason why I'm writing this now). I also had read that IDRA could cause terrible anxiety in some people, but that didn't happen to me. I thought that THC is a notorious anxiety-causing compound, so that may had been a shit idea, but I decided to do it nonetheless because THC never caused anxiety with me in any case. Only had I known what was coming...

I rolled up a super-light joint (0.4 g of weed), put on some music and started smoking. Finished the joint, everything seemed normal, the usual high. I was walking around my house with headphones and music, which I particularly enjoy when high. 

At a certain moment I noticed that the high was unusually more strong, so I put off the headphones and sat down. I noticed I was spacing out quite a bit, so I tried to stay calm by talking to myself. It worked, for the first 10 minutes lol. 

The high became increasingly stronger, it didn't even feel like weed anymore. I was completely dissociated, I had control over my body but the mind was elsewhere. Reality crumbled on itself as I was panicking. I wasn't able to tell what was real or not anymore, a new definition of fear, never experienced something like this in my life. Really a bad *fucking* trip.

The whole thing was accompanied by a strong tachycardia; I dropped on the bed and tried to stay calm. At a certain moment I was 100% positive I'd be dead in seconds.
The next two hours were a living nightmare, I would space out and then regain a bit of control over myself, then zone out again. 

Finally, it stopped very gradually. I drank water and went to sleep. Now, I got up ten minutes ago and I'm writing this report. As of now, I still feel something strange and not right. Could be that I'm still in shock, I really hope this goes away entirely. The IDRA should be out completely in about 24 hours, so I'll just chill at home today and hope for the best.

My guess is that IDRA-21, being an ampakine, which stimulates AMPA receptors, had some interaction with THC, that should impair these receptors. This enhanced the high to an unexpected point, where bad anxiety kicked in.

I hope this will help out someone eventually, or prevent someone else doing the same mistake. Thanks for your attention people, and stay safe! NEVER mix stuff up, unless you're sure that the stack works properly!

----------

EDIT #1 (15hrs after): Feeling better, still a bit shocked and feeling strange but it's definitely going away. It's interesting because I still feel the stimulation from the IDRA, so I am very focused, lol.

EDIT #2 (42hrs after): Better than yesterday, I'd say I'm back to normal. Had some trouble sleeping last night, woke up multiple times (never happens to me usually) and sleep quality was pretty bad. Can't say if I still feel the IDRA, probably got used to the stimulation by now. Will update if I crash after > 48 hours.",2017-09-19 23:13:36

Virtual EMDR Therapy Has Been My Most Powerful Nootropic. I Eradicated my Depression and Tripled my Productivity!,193,98lrev,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/98lrev/virtual_emdr_therapy_has_been_my_most_powerful/,66,1534727407.0,"I have been working on enhancing my mind for years. I medicate daily, eat a strict diet, work out, and I take 10 different nootropics/supplements on a daily basis to be at my peak performance.

But EMDR therapy has been the most powerful cognitive enhancer I have ever experienced.

Basically, EMDR works by 'blurring' disturbing memories so you can process them, and once doing so these memories no longer affect your consciousness. It does this through bi-lateral stimulation, and is said to affect your eye movements mimicking REM sleep, the brains natural recovery process. Some therapists wave a wand, use a light bar, tap on your knees, or use hand vibrators or sounds. Basically, anything to cause your eyes to move from left to right, or in circles.

The department of veterans affairs considers this the go-to therapy for veterans dealing with PTSD. https://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/treatment/therapy-med/emdr-for-ptsd.asp

I found this interesting and wanted to try for my PTSD and found a trained therapist and completed my therapy 100% cured of my PTSD. The traumatic event I experienced no longer affected my conscious or subconscious mind. Whenever I thought back to the memory, it seemed to become further and further away. I found myself no longer 'jumpy' or agitated. 

But then, I thought it might be something that could help increase productivity and motivation. After being in therapy I felt ready to do EMDR by myself at home using youtube vidoes (and later virtualemdr.com and emdrtool.org). By 'blurring' all of the memories of my past laziness, depression, and low self esteem, I wanted to see if I could change my thinking patterns. I have found that humans are always drawn to the negatives. I wanted to see if I could 'blur' the negatives and let the positives shine through, lifting my mood and motivation.

And it worked! 

I am more productive than ever, more motivated than ever, and I haven't had a 'down' day in months. As this went on, I found myself continually becoming happier and more productive as I became happier and more productive. I was able to build off of this and form better relationships, succeed more at work, and overcome my self esteem issues and feelings of being unmotivated.

I do not believe EMDR is placebo as I went in 100% skeptical and did not expect it to work. While some say it doesn't work for them, it works very well for many people. Here are some studies on EMDR: https://emdrtool.org/studies http://www.emdr.com/research-overview/

**How to start EMDR**

1. Find a trained therapist. You can do this through Psychology today and select 'emdr' in the side bar. Unlike regular therapy it won't cost much, as you may only need a month or so of sessions.

2. Do it yourself with tools like https://virtualemdr.com and https://emdrtool.org - At first I tried virtualemdr.com and it was great. The price was a bit high but there was some good information. I started EMDR tool just a few days ago and its free and has the same information and even the same tool. But if you need coaching virtual emdr is probably the best option

3. Use 'leg tapping' or find a youtube video. There are plenty of free youtube videos about EMDR and free EMDR tools. There are also videos that use sounds if you don't like moving dots.

But no matter how you do EMDR it is definetly worth trying. Just make sure to educate yourself on how to find target memories. But seriously, everyone should at least give it a shot.",2018-08-20 06:40:07

Screenshots of evidence will be posted at the end of this post.

Joe Cohen had posted a link to take an interview to join his company. In the beginning, there is text about how nobody can pass his tests and if you do you will have the opportunity to join his company which of course, as stated in the text, everybody loves. As I go along the interview everything seems fine until I run across questions that are blatantly ripped off from a standardized testing body. I googled the questions and lo and behold they are taken directly from the LSAT sample questions on their website yet another red flag. Clearly, he needs better writers if they can’t even come up with their own original testing material. I continue the interview only to find out that they are in need of not only writers and editors, but developers as well. Embedded right into SelfHacked's HR software is a Cambridge Brain Sciences game that I am familiar with. I did some more digging into Joe Cohen and found his Facebook page which states that his HR software is revolutionary and going to change how hiring is done. At this point, I think it would be in his best interest to first reach out to Cambridge Brain Sciences to see if they want to get in on his very own revolutionary software. He mentions in his Facebook post that there is “little possibility for racism or sexism” however, he doesn’t mention there is a high opportunity for plagiarism all throughout his genius software. Be wary of anything involved with this company and its owner, many others in the previous thread mentioned that he’s full of crap but this only confirms that and more.

My post and screenshot evidence from the other thread:

This is content stolen directly from the Law School Admission Council...

Here is the page it is ripped off from, if anybody has a copy of the LSAT Super Prep book from the Law School Admissions Council with the test from 1996 they can confirm this for themselves:  ISBN-13: 978-0-9793050-6-1  ISBN-10: 0-9793050-6-3  are the ISBN numbers for the book it's from. Notice how Joe Cohen changed ""coordinator of an exhibition"" to ""carpet store owner"" and then changed ""rugs"" to ""carpets"" but literally everything else is identical, what a coincidence!

Curcumin-free turmeric exhibits anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities: Identification of novel components of turmeric.

Aggarwal BB1, Yuan W, Li S, Gupta SC.


Abstract

Turmeric, a dried powder derived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, has been used for centuries in certain parts of the world and has been linked to numerous biological activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antigrowth, anti-arthritic, anti-atherosclerotic, antidepressant, anti-aging, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, wound healing, and memory-enhancing activities. One component of turmeric is curcumin, which has been extensively studied, as indicated by more than 5600 citations, most of which have appeared within the past decade. Recent research has identified numerous chemical entities from turmeric other than curcumin. It is unclear whether all of the activities ascribed to turmeric are due to curcumin or whether other compounds in turmeric can manifest these activities uniquely, additively, or synergistically with curcumin. However, studies have indicated that turmeric oil, present in turmeric, can enhance the bioavailability of curcumin. **Studies over the past decade have indicated that curcumin-free turmeric (CFT) components possess numerous biological activities including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antidiabetic activities.** Elemene derived from turmeric is approved in China for the treatment of cancer. The current review focuses on the anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities exhibited by CFT and by **some individual components of turmeric, including turmerin, turmerone, elemene, furanodiene, curdione, bisacurone, cyclocurcumin, calebin A, and germacrone.**",2018-06-20 06:31:11

Nootropics legality: It’s has been getting harder…,189,8ghi12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8ghi12/nootropics_legality_its_has_been_getting_harder/,155,1525297450.0,"I made a short list of facts below to describe what has been happening to the nootropic industry/market/community:

All has happened over the last 3-4 years.

1. Amazon prohibited selling nootropics. It happened about 4 years ago. Before that one could buy even Phenibut and even in Germany. (Disclaimer: I personally did it without any problems)
2. PayPal and other payment processors froze all accounts of nootropic vendors and declined to work with them. Happened almost three years ago. (Disclaimer: several of accounts have been shut down and money released after 180 days)
3. Reviews on Ceretropic and products descriptions had to be deleted. (I liked reading them and it was sad that they were not available anymore)
4. UK nootropic ban: it’s became illegal to sell even noopept there. (Some websites like nootropics.co.uk were gone)
5. Australia declared Phenibut illegal. (recently) But this was more or less justified because on FB too many ppl abuse it.
6. Major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase declined to work with nootropic vendors and deleted wallets of people who bought nootropics using their platforms. (2 or 3 years ago)
7. Reddit deleted many communities/posts and changed the rules on different subreddits including r/nootropics. (2-3 weeks ago)
8. A large vendor Powdercity was shut down because of a Tianeptine overdose by an adolescent. 
9. FDA raided another vendor - Awakebrain and it was shut down.
10. Youtube deleted videos of popular nootropic video bloggers. ( just 2 days ago)

This all means that it is extremely hard if not impossible to sell and to market nootropic supplements. They only can be sold “not for human consumption and without any warnings because warnings could imply actual human consumption”. 

My suggestion is that if we are to survive we need to show in a convincing, consistent and public manner thousands of people who clearly benefited from nootropics after they tried FDA-approved drugs. I know among my customers a few people who tell me this and I am sure all most of the vendors can say the same. We are not selling dangerous substances that are regularly abused by people who can’t control themselves. That is not correct.

There is definitely a free area between strong but FDA-approved drugs and lesser effective nootropics/anxiolytics approved in other countries. 

Anyway, just my thoughts on this. Feel free to comment or criticise.

And sorry for typos/mistakes

No meditation or drugs would help me. The anxiety was constant. I broke down my calories after therapy one day and realized due to the constant anxiety and nervous stomach I was only getting about 900-1200 calories a day and about 100 carbs.

It's been debilitating to say the very least. The depression creeped in at 15 and has lingered ever since. Depersonalized much later.

I noticed when I first started drinking that during an EPIC hangover, all three symptoms go away and finally, clarity sets in. My mind opens up. The same with all the individuals i'm in contact with. It's like the elixir for all our problems. 

As the night progresses, I regress into my old self. The inattentiveness, blocked thoughts, depression. We're on a hunt to find out what's going on but It's been a long time and we haven't gotten very far.

A few things worth noting:
I don't get sick, regardless of how much I drink (could be a clue). The more the better. 

Have tried everything from NADH, all the activated B's, b12/folate, Tianeptine, Noopept, D-Aspartic Acid, Aniracetam, Phenibut, Pregnenolone + an array of vitamins, supplements and noots. Nothings worked except Sarcosine which has helped very subtly. 

Nicotine and Amphetamine make me dysphoric. Stims hardly help. I'm assuming I have high acetylcholine. 

Another awesome thing that props up is my drive to be social during the hangover. I become a lot more extroverted and dis-inhibited. I become interested in having long conversations/connecting with people which is unlike my usual self. I become a lot more emotional too.

I think it could be a disruption in VTA signalling but what's causing it? Ghrelin? Insulin Resistance (had a test, everything seems fine)? Growth Hormone dysfunction?

Literally at a loss. Can't live like this.

Jan van Deursen, the researcher mentioned in the article is the co-founder of [Unity Biotechnology](https://unitybiotechnology.com/) (private/Arch Ventures) which has several senolytics in the pre-clinical stage. 

In early 2015, the team identified the first senolytics: an FDA-approved chemotherapy drug, dasatinib, which eliminates human fat-cell progenitors that have turned senescent; and a plant-derived health-food supplement, quercetin, which targets senescent human endothelial cells, among other cell types. The combination of the two — which work better together than apart — alleviates a range of age-related disorders in mice.

14 senolytics have been described in the literature, including small molecules, antibodies and, in March this year, a peptide that activates a cell-death pathway and can restore lustrous hair and physical fitness to aging mice.

Two natural compounds - quercetin and tocotrienols, an isoform of Vitamin E, are modest senolytics. ",2017-10-27 04:02:47

Interesting study on Testosterone and its relation to IQ,181,a25a2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/a25a2l/interesting_study_on_testosterone_and_its/,122,1543716672.0,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11913330

TL;DR -- having high levels of testosterone may not be the best for IQ or overall success. Neither is having super low levels. Moderation appears to be the most correlative.

S=successful
NS= not successful

""In S-men, the relationship between T and IQ was best described by a polynomial regression equation of the 3rd order; however, the relationship was not U-shaped, but rather a positive correlation (low T: low IQ and high T high IQ). ""

""In NS-men, there was an inverse U-shaped correlation between T and IQ (low and very high T: low IQ and moderate T: high IQ). 

The present data suggest that (i) very low and very high serum T concentrations may be disadvantageous, (ii) moderate T levels may be advantageous for general fluid intelligence, and (iii) a prewired cerebral organization may be essential for the T effects on cognitive abilities.""",2018-12-02 07:41:12

Although Nootropics are extremely helpful, there is no magic pill that can compare to a healthy lifestyle. Why not fine-tune your system? We're meant to be in motion. We're meant to be social. Get away from the computer and go work out and meet someone. These are the best Nootropics.

"Meditation has completely ""cured"" me of my depression.",179,4y9mxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/4y9mxm/meditation_has_completely_cured_me_of_my/,106,1471514483.0,"Hey guys. It's night time right now and I'm tired so I'm not going to do the long post I had planned. The energy from caffeine has run out lol.

So basically for the last 10 months or so I've experienced horrible depression. It was of the anhedonic variety. Maybe I'll go into depth later, but it was horrible. Suicide was often in the back of my mind.

These last two month's, after stalking some very inspiring posters on reddit, I myself was inspired to meditate. I had been mindful this last year but I wasn't putting the time in and wasn't sincerely meditating.

After a night of sleep deprivation induced anti-depressant relief, I became insanely mindful and started dutifully watching and observing my thoughts. I also started meditating for at least 5 minutes a day, but most often it was over 30 minutes, sometimes a couple of hours.

I still feel unpleasant sensations and pleasant sensations, but I simply don't care most of the time about them. In fact for the past week I've experienced varying amounts of anxiety. But it just doesn't matter. I've experienced and become more familiar with my thoughts, and realized that they're just sensations, just mental constructs, not ""me"". Pain is inevitable, suffering is a choice.

No fap has also helped. In fact, I relapsed on day 15-25, idk I forgot the date. It definitely hindered me. It's okay though. Just another thought in the wind. This past week I've waned in my time spent meditating. I am going to be mediating a lot more again.

My diet hasn't really changed, besides eating more calories again. No new nootropics really. In fact, some adaptogens I bought actually made me more depressed for a while.

At first my cognition seemed to suffer, but the longer I meditated the more enhanced and sharp I've become.

I still have a long way to go but I just thought I might inspire some people to at least check it out, start meditating.

Tomorrow I will write more in depth on my experiences, and possibly help some of you guys out if I (hopefully) can. I've noticed that some of the brightest and most frequent posters on this subreddit are depressed. You guys know who you are. I mean, jesus, it seems like everyone on this sub is depressed! Like 80% of people on this subreddit have depression. Drugs, diet, sleep, exercise, ect can help guys. But if you've lived your whole life with poor health, and the mental patterns poor health causes, then you have some work to do. Those mental patterns have been imprinted deep in your mind. Using semax to raise dopamine and serotonin and BDNF isn't going to ""cure"" you. It never ""cured"" me. No nootropic did. Those play a small role when your own mind is working against them. It's comforting to think you can buy happiness with nootropics, but in my experience and readings, you can't, and if you can, it's not sustainable, nor is it real happiness. I can't describe what real happiness is, but I've tasted it, and I know meditation is the path that leads to it. There's a reason no one you know has ever *really* seemed happy. It's because so little people are aware of the benefits meditation holds. So many people take their thoughts and feelings so seriously. None of that is you. ""You"" aren't even ""real"". There just *is*.

I would like to thank a few people on reddit for being an inspiration for my practice and helping me see the light (lol). Thank you so much. 

Edit: I want to give some background on my life so you can understand how my situation was.

Ever since my first memory, I distinctly recall dissatisfaction.

In 3rd grade, I became depressed. I often told my mom I was depressed. I think I even said I hated life, in 3rd grade. I would often cry and was an extremely sensitive kid. It was quite sad. 

In 10th grade I started experimenting with phenibut, vicodin, and tried adderall once.

In 11th grade of high school, I abused alcohol and diphenhydramine, the worst two drugs to abuse, and also drugs that don't really feel so good anyways. I had tried some low-quality ecstasy in 10th grade, half a pill, but that left me pretty depressed for a couple of days, and I feel as though it left a subtle mark in my psyche.

By the end of 11th grade, things were bad. I had hit the back of my head whilst drunk, hard, and probably gave myself a concussion. My parents caught me and my friends getting drunk that same night. When I awoke the next morning, I drank coffee on an empty stomach and had horrible heart pains, along with probable excitotoxicity. After that incident my mind was severely disturbed. Sometimes I would randomly see black lines or black dots, white dots, white lines. It's like my occipital lobe was miscalculaing what my eyes were sending it. I started having bad intrusive thoughts and OCD. Nihilism was also a theme of this time, which made me extremely depressed. I also at one point was so out of it that I thought that the CIA/other people could read my thoughts. Yeah, I know.

I had read Absolutus's thread on meditation. I at this point was still craving worldy things, and I thought perhaps meditation could turn me into Bradley Cooper on NZT. I started skipping lunch at school and meditating. I was able to talk my teacher into letting me meditate during class, in the closet, where it was quiet and dark. I meditated at least an hour a day for 3-6 months, I can't remember the exact dates. I distinctly remember reading how Absolutus cured his severe depression with meditation. I was hopeful but never really believed it possible. I know now it's possible. My experience of reality is proof.

I basically cured my major mental disorders. During the summer between 11th and 12th grade, I meditated semi-often and started using noopept. Before sleep, morning, whenever. That fucked my circadian rhythm up hard. 

In October of senior year I was hit by massive depression, anhedonic variety. I hated school. I was incredibly stressed by everything. I started using drugs again. I thought just having a Buddhist philosophy could save me. I was also still pretty goal-oriented, I wanted worldly things. I would often wish I would be killed, by anything. My mind was severely disturbed and distorted, it was delusional. I was becoming more empathetic however. I was basically anxious and depressed all day, experienced very little pleasure, and wanted to die. Towards the end of the year I used kratom in large doses daily, for about two months consistently. That didn't help things. I actually started feeling like shit from it and had to quit. Xanax and DXM and phenibut were also used towards the end of this year. Not good for me either. Xanax sent me into a depressive episode for one week straight. It was pretty bad. I cried a lot that week. Nothing made sense, it was all very confusing. ""I never asked to be born"" was a thought that appeared in my head often. ""Why must we suffer?!?"", ect.

However, after reading some inspiring posters post history (lol), I decided to fully commit myself, because the Buddha seemed to have had things figured out. Being extremely mindful, letting your thoughts appear and vanish, meditating for at least 10 minutes a day, preferably as much as possible, as well as being as ethical, empathetic, honest, and genuine as possible, treating my fellow conscious beings with love and care, imagining every person or animal or bug or small thing, as my mother, or me as their mother... Well, it's basically transformed my mental health. I don't really know what to say. My sexuality is morphing from pure lust, to a very gentle love with no sexual tones at all. I find it harder and harder to hate others. I'm not perfect, but I'm getting better and improving myself, improving my consciousness. I'm as vegetarian (No animals killed) as possible now, fuck the health detriments (I eat as well as possible for a mostly vegetarian diet, lots of milk.)

When I first got into nootropics, I thought it would turn me into an ubermensch. I was gonna use nootropics and hack my life, keep motivation and pleasure sky-high, have my mind be as sharp as a pin and operate like a super-computer. I wanted health and happiness, I wanted approval of others. I wanted fame. I wanted money. I wanted to be more attractive, more charming, more more more. At one point, when I was particularly lustfully ambitious, I wanted to rule the world. Now, my only desire is to see others be happy and healthy. My only desire is for myself to be happy and healthy.

I think a lot of you are wasting your precious time and effort and money on nootropics and research. I've spent above $1,000 while on supplements, and really they have little effect, compared to mediation. Most nootropics are band-aids. They don't help your health in the long-run. If your brain/cells thought it was a good idea to increase BDNF, it would have done so already. There's a reason you have low X or Z. It's not random. Focus on health, not ""increase dopamine/serotonin/BDNF/ect"". Unless you have an SNP that clearly shows an undesirable gene, then don't change it, try to improve health first. And one of the best ways of increasing health is mediation. We undergo so much stress just by living with our current mindsets. An unbelievable amount. We just aren't as aware of it anymore, because it's chronic, our whole lives. Just like how you aren't conscious of your shirt anymore. It's in the background. From being mindful, I've realized I've been processing life in an extremely stressful way. I bet many of you are the same as me in that regard. Did you know that people in a room with nothing to do, other than shock themselves, will shock themselves withe electricity? 63% of men, or around there, will shock themselves. Humans seem to be unable to cope without distraction. It's like something is gnawing away at the inside of us. It doesn't have to be that way. Just stop choosing distraction and start facing who you are, who you *really* are, not who you tell yourself you are. That, that is a delusion. Meditate, and you'll start to understand who you really are.

If you only research nootropics or health because you feel like you have to, in order to become superhuman, then you need to take a step back and analyze your life. For me personally, my research has become fun in-and-of-itself, so I do that in my free time, and one of my main motivators is enhancing the health of myself and others. If your only motivation is to become god, then stop.

And has anyone else noticed that so many people on this sub are so severely depressed?! I mean, it's only natural. The people who go on here either had problems they're trying to fix or they want to become a superhuman. 

I hope you are able to find something of value from my giant wall of text. I'm not thinking clearly right now but I think I said what was important for me to say. I just thought others might like to hear what I've learned from living. It's not all right but the parts that resonate with you should help you the most.

I am cured, and have never been happier in my entire life. I hope all of you can experience the same as I have. 

Strive diligently towards enlightenment and freedom.

Repeat these to yourself everyday: 

1. I am sure to become old; I cannot avoid ageing.
	
2. I am sure to become ill; I cannot avoid illness.	

3. I am sure to die; I cannot avoid death.	

4. I must be separated and parted from all that is dear and beloved to me.

5. I am the owner of my actions, heir of my actions, actions are the womb (from which I have sprung), actions are my relations, actions are my protection. Whatever actions I do, good or bad, of these I shall become the heir.

And be ethical, empathetic, honest, disciplined, moral, and genuine. You will become happy, it's just a matter of time. Meditate. Breath and be calm. 

I hope you all the best in everything you do.

I guess I could consider this edit sort of a rambling rant, but I like it's stream-of-consciousness style. It also felt cathartic in a way, kinda. 

Edit 2: After you read my post, take what resonates with you and leave the rest. Then, start meditating and following the Dhamma. If you have any questions, the Buddhism and Meditation subs on Reddit are perfect for you.

And I want to be very clear. Meditating hasn't made me a ""superhuman"" either. I am not blissed out all day (and in my opinion, feeling euphoric all day isn't really what I want, or need). I am not super charming, I am not a genius. 

In fact, the pleasant and unpleasant sensations I feel are pretty similar to how I felt a couple of months ago. It's just that now, I feel them as objects, instead of me. It's like I've taken a step back. I still feel the raw sensation of pain or pleasure, but in either case it doesn't really have any emotional ""charge"" to it. 

And I still get caught up in emotions. Though I think the feeling of getting caught up is just more sensation. I am not a ""master"". 

I just am, and that's okay.",2016-08-18 15:31:23

Give it a try right now. Make sure you breathe with your belly/diaphragm. There should be no movement in your rib cage/chest/shoulders. Place a hand on your chest to make sure.

If you can’t figure it out right away don’t worry, it can take a few attempts. Lying on your back can make it a lot easier when you’re getting started. There’s also plenty of YouTube videos with better instructions.

------

I've struggled with eating food due to my medications (stimulants).  Because of this, I have suffered from nutritional deficits.  

I was feeling really depressed and had almost no self esteem for a few weeks; life was difficult and it only made my appetite even worse.  I tried a few supplements like Boron and Ginkgo.  And although I felt a difference in my motivation and sex drive, it didn't give me the confidence I knew I was missing.

I started taking Zinc recently.  Ho-ly-shit.  This is a game changer.  Immediate effects - huge boost of confidence, sex drive at a normal level, boners that could kill, and determination and focus like you wouldn't believe. 

Try it if you aren't eating enough food and you have some of the same symptoms I had.  Just make sure you take it on a full stomach.  

------

DOSAGE AND TYPE

* Zinc Gluconate, 50 mg.
* 2-3x a day with a full meal.  I take it with a high protein and fat diet.  
* I haven't settled on the dosage yet - I'm just going by how I feel and whether or not I feel like I'm on my ""game"". 

You can buy this at most supermarkets.  I'm not going to endorse any brands.

SIDE EFFECTS

* Confidence
* Increased libido
* Determination and focus
* No ""brain fog""
* Stronger body odor",2018-03-19 06:07:41

The Ten Holy Commandments of Nootropics (WIP),177,8zmwde,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8zmwde/the_ten_holy_commandments_of_nootropics_wip/,25,1531875650.0,"I have previously expressed a desire to write a list of ten commandments for new users to follow, all with the hope of minimising the many mistakes that those without proper guidance tend to make during their journey. Below is the first iteration of these ten rules, it is to be considered WIP and I am looking for as much feedback as I can get, especially in regards to filling rules 7 and 8 - feel free to point out any changes that might be necessary. This is all based on my own personal experiences/ those commonly mentioned throughout /r/Nootropics and should serve as only a very basic guideline.

**1. Always begin with the recommended dosage or lower.**

*The body of each individual is different and each will react differently to substances, many find it easy to fall for the trap of taking more than the recommended dosage - typically motivated by a misguided belief that a larger dose will lead to a better experience. If experimenting with something for the first time - take a smaller dose and see how your body reacts to it, failure to do so can range from nothing happening all the way to the unlikely scenario of your death. Safety is of paramount importance and we don't want to hear about how you almost died because you took 10,000mg of Phenibut.*

**2. More isn't necessarily better.**

*Many Nootropics begin taking effects, whether positive or negative, after weeks of usage, acclimate yourself to your current Nootropics, ideally one at a time, before adding even more into your stack. Failure to do so will often lead you into a situation where something is making you feel terrible but you're unable to tell what because you take twenty different Nootropics, forcing you to completely stop or gradually remove things from your stack.*

**3. Lower your expectations.**

*A significant portion of Nootropics that you will be dealing with will have very subtle effects - infact the effects of many cannot truly be felt and when they are, it is often a case of expectation bias or other imperfections of the human mind. Many nootropics will provide you with a very tiny boost, if a certain Nootropic improves your memory by 5%, are you going to be able to feel such a tiny improvement? It is unlikely that you will, but it does not mean that the Nootropic isn't working.*

**4. Do your research.**

*Your preferred source of information regarding any Nootropic should be peer reviewed scientific studies, preferably ones without any cause for bias (Many studies are funded by organizations which sell Nootropics). When dealing with more obscure substances, you may have to rely heavily upon anecdotal evidence in the form of the experiences of other people as formal scientific studies don't exist. When doing so, do not take the word of any individual as law and instead look for commonalities in people's experiences, if seven out of ten individuals say that a certain Nootropic has caused panic attacks in them, it is probably not a good idea to take that Nootropic.*

**5. Correlation doesn't equal causation.**

*If you begin to experience something negative while taking a Nootropic, take a good look at your situation and ask yourself what other factors could be causing your problem - jumping straight to the conclusion that it's the Nootropic you happen to be taking is the incorrect course of action and will prolong the amount of time before your problem is fixed. Your magnesium supplement is probably not the cause of your testicular rashes.*

**6. Order only from trusted sources.**

*There are many horror stories on the internet coming from individuals who as a result of ordering from a shady source have received heavy mental poisoning or other adverse effects - such situations are rare, but they do happen and since you are dealing with your health, you should minimise the possibilities of them happening by only acquiring your Nootropics from trusted sources. If you do not receive a product that damages your health, you might receive a product which is inferior in quality, rely upon established and respected methods of acquisition.*

**7. Read everything carefully.**

*Half the problems experienced by users of Nootropics and a vast majority of questions posed on this sub could easily be eliminated if one were to clearly read the information being put before them. Even during the creation process of this list, individuals were suggesting that things are included which are already included in the list.*

**8. Cycle.**

*Cycling refers to planned pauses in your taking of Nootropics, doing so allows for a variety of different benefits such as a reduced possibility of addiction, greater awareness of the effects of different Nootropics upon your body and the avoidance of negative health effects that come with overuse. It is also suggested that you do the other type of cycling which is greatly beneficial to your health.*

**9. Don't be an idiot.**

*Think about the consequences of your actions before you perform them, impulsivity and generally irresponsible behaviour is what causes countries to gradually ban many Nootropic substances which are a great boon to responsible users.*

**10. Nootropics are not a substitute for good habits and lifestyle choices.**

*Nootropics are unlikely to fix significant problems in your life, especially not in the long term, and a belief that a Nootropic can do so can easily lead to addiction. Nootropics (especially the more potent ones) should be respected and treated as tools which assist you in reaching what you want in life, but they should not be your sole means of doing so. No amount of Nootropics will stop you from being a useless piece of shit if you're a useless piece of shit.*",2018-07-18 06:30:50
Slowing down fapping has had the biggest impact then any substance i ever tried.,177,7f1p1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/7f1p1i/slowing_down_fapping_has_had_the_biggest_impact/,155,1511491986.0,"Im not writing this to convince anyone about anything, i just want to write down my experience and maybe someone benefits from it.

I tried a whole bunch of stuff and while many things work in some way, they have their side effects as well. But nothing comes even close to abstaining from fapping for a while.

I intentionally wrote ""slowing"" in the title, as my experience has not much to do with the nofap hype. Abstaining from fapping for longer then a week has rather negative impacts for me, like losing interest in things, getting demotivated, unable to do things as im so hypersexual that i cant concentrate, etc. If i slow down from everyday fapping to every 3-4th day (ymmv), im a different person. Literally. And im writing this after several ""cycles"" of going back to my old self. 

Im self employed and get job offers for different things and with daily fapping im denying 70% of the stuff. With the slowed down fapping version of me, my whole week is full of work as im so darn happy and motivated, that i feel like im a different person. Besides that, my social anxiety is... gone. Im talkative like a parrot on cocaine. And all this without any side effects and for free.

Regarding porn, thats a whole different story. Being in a relationship since 17 years without sex since a few years, porn destroys my interest in woman - which is a good thing for me. But it doesnt destroy my motivation, doing it every 3rd or 4th day. For any single, i wouldnt recommend watching porn though. Makes sex much more intense and interesting.

So while this might be nothing new for many, it has such a big impact for my life, that i want to get it some attention and maybe someone benefits like i do.

Edit: I just realized, i wouldve never ever wrote this as my old self. ",2017-11-24 08:23:06

The Problem With Dopaminergics,174,8xyzgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8xyzgf/the_problem_with_dopaminergics/,157,1531339473.0,"Instant vs Delayed Gratification

We are all chasing dopamine in our lives. Being a nootropics user for some time, I have come to realization that the time it takes for you to achieve gratification or dopamine release is one of the biggest factor of how we live our lives and how we progress though it.  People have been using a lot of agonists and receptor modulators in the nootropics community but if I had to pick the most powerful of them all, I would select dopaminergics. An increase in the dopamine not only makes us forget everything in our surroundings to achieve our goals but also gives an extreme feeling of high when one achieves these dreams. 

The problem starts when you have an artificial boost of dopamine in your body. Rapid receptor and enzyme down regulation to maintain a neurochemical balance hits the user. And then you want more and more to do less and less. Every goal involves time. And 'time' is the biggest enemy of someone who is using artificial boosts to stay afloat. Goals that require a few days to a week to get done seem easy, but as soon as we strive to achieve long term goals, we start suffering from the curse of cycling. Having down times, crashes, prolonged periods of low or no activity to get back to how we were functioning previously become a norm. Productivity decreases and the dose increases. We start to look for alternatives, synthetic precursors and receptor up regulators creep up in our stacks. While hating our down times we start fantasizing about our first dose effects. We revisit our first online posts about how great the supplement made us feel. We 'don't feel the same' again and begin to obsess over each supplement's mode of action. Going through hundreds of articles on PubMed does not bring the same honeymoon period back. We decide to quit cold turkey. Go for a reboot. More down times and more days are wasted. And after a few days we pick up the same stack again.

I have no problem with nootropics but the ones I love and hate at the same time are dopaminergics. Over the past few months I have started to come off most of my supplements. It was hard but it was worth effort. I now have a much better idea of who I am. I have started to listen to my body rather than throwing it off its balance every time I want to. We are neurologically diverse beings. Every one is different and no one comes with a manual. It takes time, energy and way more effort to write a manual for ourselves. But once you start familiarizing yourself with the inner workings of your mind, it becomes easier to accomplish tasks that you were 'too lazy' or 'too unmotivated' to accomplish. There are a lot of people amongst us who benefit from medications and supplements. Exhibiting anhedonia, mania, extreme inattention and dysphoria in life crosses that line between stable but biologically diverse beings and pathology. For those, having someone else ( a professional) give them insight about their problems and prescribing them appropriate medications is the only way to go. Self diagnosing without insight is dangerous and professional help is compulsory for them. But for the rest of us, keep it simple. Take time to learn about yourself first and then experiment later. You are capable of far more than you can imagine but no magic pill is going to fix everything. The stable dopamine release after achieving something because of working hard for an extended period of time will never be comparable to any motivation boosters. Getting hooked on that delayed surge makes us want more, bigger goals, bigger passion and bigger accomplishments are required to achieve the same boost again. This delayed gratification cycle has turned average people into giants. Craving success becomes a norm for them. The pursuit of this gratification wakes them up at 4 AM every day. It is easy for us to reward our children or pets with toys or treats after they accomplish something to reinforce their behavior, but hard for us to do the same for ourselves. The knowledge from accumulated from endless experiments on monkeys in laboratories is useless to us if we cannot practice self control for delayed gratification. These supplements may help you get out of your bed a few times, but not forever.

If you are looking into changing your stack, remember to give a good hard look at the list of dopaminergics that you are taking, you'll thank yourself later.",2018-07-12 01:34:33

Really cool considering how cheap, tasty and readily available mackerel is. Also since phosphatidylserine bound to DHA is considered more beneficial for the brain than phosphatidylserine by itself, phosphatidylserine in mackerel probably beats other sources in more than one way.

I have been eating mackerel daily for two weeks now and I feel pretty great, for what it's worth. I also respond pretty well to soy lecithin derived phosphatidylserine supplements but they are just ludicrously expensive to get a dose of 300-500mg daily.

One normal sized Atlantic mackerel is 350g, of which 200g you can eat probably, which costs me 1 euro. That's up to 900mg phosphatidylserine for 1 euro, which is super cheap.

EDIT: Atlantic mackerel is also one of the lower mercury fish, so is safe for regular consumption.

""BNC210 is a novel small molecule, orally-administered drug candidate being developed for anxiety and trauma- and stressor-related disorders, that we believe has similar efficacy but improved tolerability compared to currently available drugs such as benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs. BNC210 is a first-in-class highly-selective negative allosteric modulator of the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine (alpha-7) receptor. Acetylcholine and the alpha-7 receptor are increasingly being implicated in the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Furthermore, the alpha- 7 receptor is highly expressed in the amygdala, which forms part of the emotional centre of the brain. To date, BNC210 has been evaluated in seven completed clinical trials in over 200 subjects. Recruitment has just been completed in a Phase 2 PTSD trial.""

""The results of the study show that BNC210 induced statistically significant changes in cerebral perfusion (300mg BNC210, p<0.05) and also significantly reduced amygdala activation in response to fearful faces during the EFT (300mg BNC210, p<0.05). In comparison, lorazepam exerted a modest suppressive effect on amygdala activation during performance of the EFT (1.5mg lorazepam, p=0.069).

Extensive evidence indicates that the amygdala plays a major role in fear and anxiety reactions. The data from this study indicates that BNC210 may exert anti-anxiety effects in patients via suppression of amygdala activation.""


There is not much else to say about it: as strong as benzo without any of their known side effect (impaired cognition, addiction ecc), possibly could prevent panic attack.

EDIT:There is a lab that could sell 1g for 365, but considering that the dose ranges from 100 to 600mg its not worth it, if many people would like to buy we could do a group buy from a china lab and get it synthesised in bulk at a better cost.

What I learned from a blind self trial of 5 compounds,172,6m2rn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6m2rn9/what_i_learned_from_a_blind_self_trial_of_5/,50,1499569248.0,"###In short:
I tested piracetam, aniracetam, oxiracetam, noopept, N-acetyl cysteine, and a placebo for 5 days each. None of the compounds had significant effects* at the doses and durations tested. Blinding was simple, finding time without external stressors and confounds was challenging, and assessing relevant performance was extremely difficult. Inadequate assessments and, for the racetams, inadequate durations are the most likely limitations.

###Methods & Results

Over the course of seven weeks, I dosed for 5 days and left two days for clearance. I dosed either nothing, piracetam (800 mg), aniracetam (750 mg), oxiractam (750 mg), noopept (30 mg), N-acetyl cysteine (500 mg), or cornstarch placebo orally in capsules twice a day. I assessed reaction time and digit span (Human Benchmark) and subjective mood, energy, and mental sharpness on a scale of 1 - 10. I made no other supplement changes during this period, consuming typically two cups of tea, several vitamins, and collagen. I consumed alcohol twice during this period on clearance days.

I tested the means of each of the 5 measured values against placebo, for a total of 25 tests. None were significant at p = 0.01. At p = 0.05, only one was significant (piracetam worsens subjective energy by 0.6 out of 10), but given the number of tests, this is likely a false positive.

I noted an unusual number of headaches during noopept dosing (2 in 5 days vs ~0.5 per week typically). I had several trippy dreams on aniracetam. I did not try to quantitatively assess significance for these side effects.

###Discussion and Outlook

The lack of effect on measured variables could be because (1) none of the compounds are very effective for me (2) none of the compounds are very effective for me at that dose and dosing duration or (3) improvements are not reflected in the variables I measured.

It's possible that there are effects that are too small compared with the typical fluctuations. This is relatively uninteresting to me, as I am not interested in paying for supplements if the effects are much below the uncertainty here. That is, even though more data would allow smaller effects to be statistically significant, I likely would consider them not clinically significant.

The relatively short duration is a problem for racetams, and piracetam was likely underdosed. Finding extended periods of time without major external events is a bit tricky, so I would have to cut back to one compound to do a better, longer study. I was originally planning something longer but kept pushing it back to avoid trips, stressors, etc. and had to be less ambitious for this study.

I was not happy with any of the assessments I found. I wanted something that was unobtrusive to test during the afternoon and not very time consuming, hence the two quantitative and three subjective measures. For anything with a dramatic effect, I think I might see it, but subjective ratings of mental performance are rather questionable.

In general, I am OK with the statistical power of this experiment. I would consider doing longer experiments mainly to observe the effect of compounds that act less acutely. None of the compounds here seem particularly promising for me, but piracetam wasn't really given a fair chance. I would likely try different compounds in the future. Methodologically, I'm most interested in finding better assessments.

Though perhaps not a nootropic, I think next I may try a dose-dependent study of the effects of GABA. People claim that a non-null response to GABA indicates a damaged blood-brain barrier, but anecdotes are problematic due to placebo effect. It would be neat if we could build up some placebo-controlled evidence for whether individuals respond differently to GABA and maybe correlate that to the effectiveness of other things, so it could be used as a diagnostic. Well, maybe.

This is a bit long already, so I'll end it here, but I'm happy to go into more details if needed. It'd be nice to see more people doing this sort of thing, even if not quantitatively, at least doing a blind comparison when trying something for the first time.

*Edit:* Thanks for the feedback, everyone! To add some background, this was something I decided to do after already having gotten some compounds to try and was just meant to be one step up from trying them casually. It is a bit silly to try racetams for 5 days. (There seem to be plenty of anecdotes here of effects within a few days, but the more robust benefits should be after weeks.)

Even still, being consistent about routines, doing the assessments, and avoiding confounds actually takes some commitment. I had questioned whether it was worthwhile at the time, but the response here has convinced me. I don't think I'll try to test 5 compounds at once again, but I'll certainly do something in the future.",2017-07-09 08:30:48
